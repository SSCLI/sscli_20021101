Function = WSAEventSelect
Name = Positive Test for WSAEventSelect
TYPE = DEFAULT
EXE1 = test7
Description
= This test simulates multiple access to a server using multiple 
= client thread. The main function thread serves for accepting 
= connection from clients thread. WSAEventSelect is used with 
= FD_ACCEPT in order to provide a event-driven accept. 
= For every client that connect, the  main thread creates a server 
= thread, it will handle data exchange with that client. Client 
= thread are created on the fly for every iteration of the main for
= loop. Every client will wait few seconds to get a chance to connect
= to the server. If a failure occurs with a client, the test 
= continues and an error will be triggered by a call to Fail() at the
= end of the main thread. This procedure insures that all allocated 
= handle and ressources are unallocated. The amount of data 
= transfered are known by the server and the client. As soon as they 
= have the expected number of bytes received, they will stop receiving
= data and start replying on the the same socket.
