** Source: wsasend5_client.c (WSASend, WSARecv)
**
** Purpose: This test sends and receives a large amount of buffer. At 400th 
**          WSASend, a shutdown is done on the server. Then the client should
**          immediately stop sending data and close normally. A check is done
**          to verify that information has been sent correctly.The operations
**          are TCP, Blocking and Overlapped.
** 
** Dependencies: PAL_Initialize
**               PAL_Terminate
**               Fail
**               WSAStartup
**               WSACleanup
**               socket
