** Source:  SetFileAttributesA.c
**
**
** Purpose: Tests the PAL implementation of the SetFileAttributesA function
** Test that we can set a file READONLY, and then that we're unable to 
** open that file with WRITE access.  Then change it to NORMAL attributes, and
** try to open it again -- it should work now.
**
** Depends:
**        CreateFile
**        CloseHandle
