/*============================================================
**
** Source: childprocess.c
**
** Purpose: Test to ensure that OpenEventW() works when
** opening an event created by another process. The test
** program launches this program as a child, which creates
** a named, initially-unset event. The child waits up to
** 10 seconds for the parent process to open that event
** and set it, and returns PASS if the event was set or FAIL
** otherwise. The parent process checks the return value
** from the child to verify that the opened event was
** properly used across processes.
**
** Dependencies: PAL_Initialize
**               PAL_Terminate
**               CreateEventW
**               WaitForSingleObject
**               CloseHandle
