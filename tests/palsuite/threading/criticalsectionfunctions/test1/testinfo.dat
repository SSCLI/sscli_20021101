Section = threading
Function = InitializeCriticalSection / EnterCriticalSection / LeaveCriticalSection / DeleteCriticalSection
Name = Positive Test for InitializeCriticalSection, EnterCriticalSection, LeaveCriticalSection and DeleteCriticalSection
TYPE = DEFAULT
EXE1 = initializecriticalsection
Description 
= Implementation of Producer / Consumer IPC problem using the 
= "CriticalSection" functions to provide a mutual exclusion mechanism.
= This test case exercises InitializeCriticalSection, EnterCriticalSection,
= LeaveCriticalSection, DeleteCriticalSection, and WaitForSingleObject 
= functions.  
= This case doesn't work with more than one producer and one consumer.  
= The producer thread and consumer thread each take turns blocking on 
= the CriticalSection object and do not have any other synchronization 
= mechanisms.  This prevents adding producers or consumers as there are
= no mechanisms to block them once the buffer is full.
