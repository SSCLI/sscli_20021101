Version = 1.0
Section = exception_handling
Function = PAL_FINALLY
Name = Test for nested PAL_FINALLY
Type = DEFAULT 
EXE1 = pal_finally
Description
= Tests the PAL implementation of the PAL_FINALLY in the presence
= of a call stack. An exception is forced and passed to two nested
= exception filters for consideration.  The first filter returns
= EXCEPTION_CONTINUE_SEARCH so the second can run and return
= EXCEPTION_EXECUTE_HANDLER.  The initial exception handler should
= be skipped, and the second executed, and all the PAL_FINALLY
= blocks handled.
