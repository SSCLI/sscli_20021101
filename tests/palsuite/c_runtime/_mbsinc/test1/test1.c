**
** Purpose:
** Ensure that this function moves the string pointer ahead one character.
** First do a basic test to check that the pointer gets moved ahead the one
** character. Then try with an array of bytes and a NULL array.  Each of 
** these should still work by returning a pointer to thePointer+1.
