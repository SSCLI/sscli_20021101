** Purpose: 
** Ensure that this functions increases a string pointer by n characters.
** Use a for loop, and increase the pointer by a different number of characters
** on each iteration, ensure that it is indeed pointing to the correct location
** each time.  The second test checks to see if you attempt to increase the 
** pointer past the end of the string, the pointer should just point at the 
** last character.
