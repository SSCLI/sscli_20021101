**
** Source:  test1.c
**
** Purpose: Tests the PAL implementation of the feof function.
**          Open a file, and read some characters.  Check that
**          feof states that it hasn't gone by the EOF.  Then
**          read enough characters to go beyond the EOF, and check
**          that feof states this is so.
**
** Depends:
**     fopen
**     fread
**
