Version = 1.0
Section = C Runtime
Function = getenv
Name = Test retrieval of variables correctly, and failure if they don't exist
TYPE = DEFAULT
EXE1 = test1
Description
= Create an environment variable and then use getenv to get
= a pointer to it.  Check that the pointer is valid and that the string
= is what we expected.  Also check that searching for a non-existent 
= variable will cause getenv to return NULL.  Also check that changing
= the case (upper or lower) of a variable does not effect functionality.
