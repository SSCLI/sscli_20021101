** Purpose:
** Test to see that you can copy a portion of a string into a new buffer.
** Also check that the strncpy function doesn't overflow when it is used.
** Finally check that if the number of characters given is greater than the 
** amount to copy, that the destination buffer is padded with NULLs.
