**
** Purpose: 
** Test _isnan with a number of trivial values, to ensure they indicated that
** they are numbers.  Then try with Positive/Negative Infinite, which should
** also be numbers.  Finally set the least and most significant bits of 
** the fraction to positive and negative, at which point it should return
** the true value.
