Microsoft Passport: A Key Component of the .NET Vision
Passport is a key part of the advanced software that will drive the next-generation Internet. Microsoft .NET is the Web services platform for empowering applications, services, and devices to work together to enable access to and action on information anytime, any place, from any smart device.

Microsoft .NET shifts focus from individual Web sites and devices to constellations of computers, devices, and services that work together to deliver broader, richer solutions. Internet users will have control over how, when, and what information is delivered to them. Businesses will be able to offer that information, plus products and services, on a range of devices including cell phones, handheld computers, and desktop computers.

Passport is the key to enabling this collaborative experience in the .NET environment. Passport single sign-in (SSI) identifies people online. Implementing Passport allows you to recognize users and personalize their experience on your site, giving them the information they want, when they want it. With more than 130 million users, Passport is one of the largest Internet-based identification services available.

As .NET evolves, Microsoft will offer more Web services that do things such as locate people, check their schedules, and notify them of events. A person's identity is essential to these orchestrated services, so Passport SSI is crucial to making scenarios like this a reality.
