#The following CorDbg test scenarios are intended to provide basic
#coverage of the CorDbg debugger commands. Some of the inputs are 
#MT and throw exceptions. The scenarios are not intended to cover 
#aspx, web service, or other related debugging scenarios.
#Scenario 01:
#	Invoke all of the CorDbg commands (with options) with no debuggee
#	process present.
#Scenario 02:
#	Single step, set/hit/delete breakpoints, show source, show stack traces,
#	navigate stack traces, and print variables along strategic points of
#	a MT C# program.	
#Scenario 03:
#	Set/hit/remove breakpoints, associate source with a specific breakpoint,
#	show source, single step into/over/out, show stack traces, and print 
#	variables along strategic points of a MT C# program.	
#Scenario 04:
#	Set/hit breakpoints, show source, obtain threads, show stack traces,
#	navigate stack traces, print variables, single step, show modules/
#	global functions/classes, show disassembly, and show appdomains along	 
#	strategic points of a MT C# program.
#Scenario 05:
#	Display the help for every CorDbg command.
#
#Scenario 06:
#	Display/modify CorDbg debugging modes, show stack traces, single step,
#	set/hit/remove breakpoints, dump memory, show disassembly, kill and
#	rerun debugging session, and print variables along strategic points
#	of a MT C# program.
#Scenario 07:
#	Set/hit breakpoints, perform various funcevals, print variables, and
#	show source along strategic points of a C# program.
#Scenario 08:
#	Catch/ignore class/module/exception/thread events, single step into/over
#	instructions, and show dissasembly along strategic points of a MT C# 
#	program.
#Scenario 09:
#	Set/display variables values, show source/disassembly, show the registers,
#	set/hit/remove breakpoints, single step, and get the instruction count 
#	(wt command) along strategic points of a MT C# program.
#Scenario 10:
#	Display/modify memory, show source/disassembly, set next statement, and 
#	single step along strategic points of a MT C# program.
