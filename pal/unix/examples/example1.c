 * Example of minimal program running under PAL.
 *
 * Run it using:
 *   export PAL_DBG_CHANNELS="+all.all"
 *   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:..
 *   ./example1
 *
 * With the PAL_DEBUG_CHANNELS environment variable set as above you
 * should see a trace output when the program runs. Setting
 * LD_LIBRARY_PATH is necessary unless you have installed librotor_pal.so in
 * a standard location.
 *
 * Build notes :
 * Since the PAL uses pthreads, some options must be passed to gcc to tell it
 * to link against thread-safe versions of the standard libraries.
 * On FreeBSD, use gcc -pthread
