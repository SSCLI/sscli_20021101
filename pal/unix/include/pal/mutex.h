Function : 
    
    MutexWaitOn:

    Check if the mutex is signaled. If not signaled place
    the current thread to the list of waiting thread. This function is
    called by WaitXXXX functions when it's time to wait on a Mutex.
    The caller is responsible for blocking the thread, this function does
    not wait on the mutex.

Parameters
    IN hMutex   mutex checked to see if it is signaled
    SHMPTR wait_state : shared memory pointer to waiting thread's wait state

returns
    -1: an error occurred, SetLastError is called in this function.
    0: the mutex is signaled.
    1: if the mutex is not signaled.
    2: the mutex is not signaled, but was abandoned by the thread that was 
       holding it

/*++
Function :

    MutexRemoveWaitingThread

        Remove the CurrentThreadId from the list of waiting thread. This
        function is called when the current thread stops waiting on a Mutex
        for a different reason than the Mutex was signaled. (e.g. a timeout,
        or the thread was waiting on multiple objects and another object was
        signaled)

Parameters
    
        IN hMutex   mutex which the waiting thread list is updated

Returns
        -1: an error occurred
        0: if the thread wasn't found in the list.
        1: if the thread was removed from the waiting list.
