Function:
  EventWaitOn

  Check if the event is signaled. If not signaled place
  the current thread to the list of waiting thread. This function is
  called by WaitXXXX functions when it's time to wait on a Event.
  The caller is responsible for blocking the thread, this function does
  not wait on the event.

  This function set the last error, if an error occured.

Parameters:
    IN hEvent: handle of the event checked for the signaled state.
    SHMPTR wait_state : shared memory pointer to waiting thread's wait state
    
returns
	-1: an error occurred, SetLastError is called in this function.
	0: the event is not signaled.
    1: if the event is signaled.

/*++
Function:
  EventRemoveWaitingThread

  Remove the CurrentThreadId from the list of waiting thread. This
  function is called when the current thread stop waiting on an Event
  for a different reason than the Event was signaled. (e.g. a timeout,
  or the thread was waiting on multiple objects and another object was
  signaled)

Parameters:
    IN hEvent:   event handle of the modify thread waiting list.    

returns
	-1: an error occurred, SetLastError is called in this function.
	0: if the thread wasn't found in the list.
    1: if the thread was removed from the waiting list.
