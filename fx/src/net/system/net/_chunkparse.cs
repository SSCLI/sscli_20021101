            SkipPastCRLF - Skip past the terminating CRLF.

            An internal utility function. This is used to skip over any chunk
            extensions or footers in a chunked response. We look through the
            source bytes looking for the terminating CRLF, honoring any quoted
            strings we see in the process.

            Input:
                    Source      - An IReadChunkBytes interface which we can
                                    use to read the bytes from.


            Returns:

                The number of bytes we consumed, or -1 if there wasn't enough
                in the buffer. We'll return a 0 if there's some sort of syntax
                error.
