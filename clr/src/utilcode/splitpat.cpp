*_splitpath() - split a path name into its individual components
*
*Purpose:
*       to split a path name into its individual components
*
*Entry:
*       path  - pointer to path name to be parsed
*       drive - pointer to buffer for drive component, if any
*       dir   - pointer to buffer for subdirectory component, if any
*       fname - pointer to buffer for file base name component, if any
*       ext   - pointer to buffer for file name extension component, if any
*
*Exit:
*       drive - pointer to drive string.  Includes ':' if a drive was given.
*       dir   - pointer to subdirectory string.  Includes leading and trailing
*           '/' or '\', if any.
*       fname - pointer to file base name
*       ext   - pointer to file extension, if any.  Includes leading '.'.
