; These are the managed resources for mscorlib.dll.  
; See those first three characters in the file?  This is in UTF-8.  Leave
; the Unicode byte order mark written in UTF-8 at the start of this file.

; For resource info, see the ResourceManager documentation and the ResGen tool,
; which is a managed app using ResourceWriter, and InternalResGen, an 
; unmanaged version of ResGen to avoid circular dependencies in our build.
; These resources are used in mscorlib AND inside the EE, in the VM directory.

; The naming scheme is: [Namespace.] ExceptionName _ Reason
; We'll suppress "System." where possible.
; Examples:
; Argument_Null
; Reflection.TargetInvokation_someReason

; Usage Notes:
; * Keep exceptions in alphabetical order by package
; * A single space may exist on either side of the equal sign.
; * Follow the naming conventions.
; * Any lines starting with a "#" or ";" are ignored
; * Equal signs aren't legal characters for keys, but may occur in values.
; * Correctly punctuate your sentences.  Most resources should end in a period.
;       Remember, your mother will probably read some of these messages.
; * You may use \n and \t.
