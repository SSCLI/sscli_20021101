// Non-thread safe allocator designed for allocations with the following
// pattern:
//      allocate, allocate, allocate ... deallocate all
// There may also be recursive uses of this allocator (by the same thread), so
// the usage becomes:
//      mark checkpoint, allocate, allocate, ..., deallocate back to checkpoint
//
// Allocations come from a singly linked list of blocks with dynamically
// determined size (the goal is to have fewer block allocations than allocation
// requests).
//
// Allocations are very fast (in the case where a new block isn't allocated)
// since blocks are carved up into packets by simply moving a cursor through
// the block.
//
// Allocations are guaranteed to be quadword aligned.
