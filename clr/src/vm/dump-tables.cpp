 * File: dump-tables.cpp
 *
 * Rationale
 * ---------
 * In the beginning...there was Strike.  And Strike was good.  It allowed
 * attaching NTSD to a managed process/dump file to get information about the
 * process, which was useful for debugging.
 *
 * Strike had one problem: in order to operate, it required full PDBs for the
 * entire runtime.  This wasn't usually an issue, as the only people who
 * needed Strike had access to the PDBs.
 *
 * However, PSS wanted a version of strike that they could send to customers.
 * Their customers would often have problems, and the usual ways PSS helped
 * was through "trace files" or dump files.
 *
 * With trace files, PSS sends the customer a DLL and a script, and directs
 * the customer to execute the script (which attaches NTSD, executes some more
 * script, and saves the output).  The output is sent back to PSS for review,
 * and (hopefully) a solution to the customers problem.
 *
 * The problem with this is that debugging in the CLR requires assistance from
 * the managed process, which prevents NTSD from being used as a managed
 * debugger.  Additionally, using a managed debugger (e.g. cordbg) might not
 * be possible because it might not be on their machine, while NTSD will
 * *always* be on their machine.
 *
 * Thus, we needed an NTSD extension DLL that does what Strike does, but
 * without requiring PDBs.  This is Son Of Strike (SOS).
 *
 * Strike required PDBs so that it could duplicate key data structures within
 * its own address space.  For example, if it came across an ArrayClass in the
 * debugged process, it "knows" that it has a member named ``m_dwRank''.  What
 * it *doesn't* know is the correct offset of the member from the beginning of
 * the class, as that could change as members are added/moved.
 *
 * In general, Strike needed PDBs for 2 things: offsets of members within a
 * class, and addresses of global (and class-static) variables.
 *
 * Both of these can be done by using table lookup instead of PDBs.
 * Additionally, this isn't considered to be an IP leak because the table is
 * just a bunch of numbers.  There's no way to correspond the actual number in
 * the table to a class-name member-name without consulting
 * ``inc/dump-types.h'', which shouldn't leave the company.
 *
 * The table itself is stored as a global variable with an unnamed export, so
 * only SOS knows what the correct entry is.
 *
 *
 * Table Layout
 * ------------
 * In the abstract, the table is a two-dimensional jagged array of ULONG_PTRs.
 * The row is a class, while the offset is a member.
 *
 * The reality is more complicated.
 * The global variable is of type ClassDumpTable, which contains an array of
 * pointers to ClassDumpInfo objects (see ``inc/dump-tables.h'').  Each
 * ClassDumpInfo object contains a class size, the number of members, and a
 * pointer to an array of members:
 *
 *    ClassDumpTable
 *      - version
 *      - nentries
 *      + classes
 *        - Class Foo
 *          - classSize
 *          - nmembers
 *          + memberOffset
 *            - member 1
 *            - member 2
 *            - ...
 *        - Class Bar
 *            - ...
 *        - ...
 *
 * Overall, it's far easier to consider it as a two-dimensional jagged array;
 * the array of pointers to classes, etc., is merely an implementation detail
 * to make it easier to use macros to construct the table.
 *
 * To look up an entry, you need two things: the class index, and the member
 * index.  Both of these are generated in ``inc/dump-type-info.h''.
 *
 * With these two items, you use the class index to read the correct
 * ClassDumpInfo member from the ClassDumpTable::classes array, and then use
 * the member index to read the correct ULONG_PTR value from the
 * ClassDumpInfo::memberOffsets array.
 *
 *
 * Table Generation
 * ----------------
 * To generate the table, we provide an implementation of the macros used in
 * ``inc/dump-types.h''.  A typical entry in the file is like:
 *
 *    BEGIN_CLASS_DUMP_INFO(ClassName)
 *      CDI_CLASS_MEMBER_OFFSET(member)
 *      CDI_CLASS_STATIC_ADDRESS(static_member)
 *      CDI_GLOBAL_ADDRESS(global)
 *    END_CLASS_DUMP_INFO(ClassName)
 *
 * This gets expanded into:
 *
 *    struct ClassName_member_offset_info
 *      {
 *      typedef ClassName _class;
 *      static ULONG_PTR members[];
 *      };
 *
 *    ULONG_PTR ClassName_member_offset_info::members[] =
 *      {
 *      offsetof (_class, member),
 *      &_class::static_member,
 *      &global,
 *      (ULONG_PTR) -1  // for end of table
 *      };
 *
 *    ClassDumpInfo g_ClassName_member_offset_info_info = 
 *      {
 *      sizeof (ClassDumpInfo),
 *      3,
 *      & ClassName_member_offset_info::members;
 *      };
 *
 * This allows us to build a compile-time table of all offsets/addresses
 * required by strike, with the correct member indexes for a given class.
 *
 * To build the class indexes, we need another table.  This second table is
 * also present in ``inc/dump-types.h'', which is like:
 *
 *    BEGIN_CLASS_DUMP_TABLE(ExportName)
 *      CDT_CLASS_ENTRY(ClassName)
 *      // ...other classes...
 *    END_CLASS_DUMP_TABLE(ExportName)
 *
 * This gets expanded into two things: a table for the class indexes, and the
 * actual table named "ExportName".
 *
 * The class indexes are generated as:
 * 
 *    ClassDumpInfo* g_ExportName_classes[] = 
 *      {
 *      & g_ClassName_member_offset_info_info,
 *      // ... other classes...
 *      0
 *      };
 *
 * While the actual table is initialized as:
 *
 *    ClassDumpTable ExportName = 
 *      {
 *      0,  // version
 *      1,  // # entries
 *      & g_ExportName_classes    // actual classes held
 *      };
 *
 * Of course, macro "trickery" is used to determine the number of elements in
 * the array (instead of an explicit number), but this is the high-level
 * overview.
 *
 * Once this is done, ``ExportName'' is our table that can be used instead of
 * PDBs.
 *
 *
 * Warnings
 * --------
 * Alas, life can't be quite this simple.  Since we're constrained to the C
 * pre-processor, there is less flexibility in the system than is required.
 * For example, some members are (not) present based on whether or not
 * preprocessor variables are (un)set.
 *
 * This is taken to an extreme in ``gc_heap'', where some members are static
 * members on Workstation builds, and non-static members on Server builds.
 *
 * Other members are only present in debug builds.
 *
 * To allow the use of these members, their complexity had to be "pushed up"
 * into the name of the macros.  Thus, a member present only on debug builds
 * is introduced with the CDI_CLASS_MEMBER_OFFSET_DEBUG_ONLY() macro.
 *
 * There are a number of scenarios like this, and more are likely to come up
 * in the future.
 *
 * This is the principal reason that there are 17+ macros used for the tables,
 * instead of (the preferrable) 8.  (Minimum, I'd expect BEGIN/END macros for
 * each class (2), macros for member offsets/static addresses/global addresses
 * (3), BEGIN/END for the table (2), and for each class in the table (1).)
 *
 * When in doubt, run ``cl /E'' on this file to see what the preprocessor is
 * generating.  It's often the only way to determine what's wrong with a
 * specific table.
