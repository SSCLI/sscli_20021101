// StubMgr.h
//
// The stub manager exists so that the debugger can accurately step through 
// the myriad stubs & wrappers which exist in the EE, without imposing undue 
// overhead on the stubs themselves.
//
// Each type of stub (except those which the debugger can treat as atomic operations)
// needs to have a stub manager to represent it.  The stub manager is responsible for
// (a) identifying the stub as such, and
// (b) tracing into the stub & reporting what the stub will call.  This
//        report can consist of
//              (i) a managed code address
//              (ii) an unmanaged code address
//              (iii) another stub address
//              (iv) a "frame patch" address - that is, an address in the stub, 
//                      which the debugger can patch. When the patch is hit, the debugger
//                      will query the topmost frame to trace itself.  (Thus this is 
//                      a way of deferring the trace logic to the frame which the stub
//                      will push.)
//
// The set of stub managers is extensible, but should be kept to a reasonable number
// as they are currently linearly searched & queried for each stub.
