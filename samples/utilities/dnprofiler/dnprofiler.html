<h1> DNProfiler Sample</h1>


<h2>Sample Overview</h2>


<p>The DNProfiler sample is derived from an &quot;Under The Hood&quot;
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/01/12/Hood/Hood0112.asp">
article</a> by Matt Pietrek on the Microsoft&reg; Developer Network&reg; (MSDN) (<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com">msdn.microsoft.com</a>).&nbsp; The source code was modified to 
support the Shared Source CLI (SSCLI) by removing the dependency on the registry 
and adding a new environment variable.&nbsp; </p>

 
<p>Information on the Microsoft&reg; .NET Framework profiling APIs is available in 
the Profiling.doc file in the Microsoft&reg; .NET Framework SDK, in the Tool 
Developers Guide\docs directory.&nbsp; Consult the MSDN article for more 
information on the functionality provided by this sample and the profiling API.&nbsp; </p>

 
<p>This sample differs from the code described by the MSDN article in the use of 
COM and the registry. COM registration is replaced by an environment 
variable, COR_PROFILER_DLL in profiler_on.bat, that contains the path to the 
DNProfiler.dll on Microsoft Windows&reg;.</p>

 
<p>The SSCLI version of the sample also does not support the DN_PROFILER_BREAK 
option, which causes a break point when the profiler is initialized. To 
obtain similar functionality, set a breakpoint in 
CProfilerCallback::Initialize(IUnknown * pICorProfilerInfoUnk) in
<a href="profilercallback.cpp">profilercallback.cpp</a>.</p>

 
<p>To use this sample on UNIX system-based platforms, create a script that sets the same environment 
variables found in profiling_on.bat. Set the COR_PROFILER_DLL environment 
variable to contain the path to the libdnprofiler.so dynamic library file.</p>

<h2>Sample Source and Build Output Locations</h2>


<p>The sample source is found in sscli\samples\utilities\dnprofiler.&nbsp; </p>


<p>The source files are:</p>


<ul class="none">
  <li><a href="comstuff.cpp">comstuff.cpp</a></li>
  <li><a href="dnprofiler.def">dnprofiler.def</a></li>
  <li><a href="profilercallback.cpp">profilercallback.cpp</a></li>
  <li><a href="profilercallback.h">profilercallback.h</a></li>
</ul>


<p>The build output location is %TARGETCOMPLUS%\samples\utilities\dnprofiler.&nbsp; 
The output file is a dynamic library named:</p>


<ul>
  <li>dnprofiler.dll on Microsoft&reg; Windows.</li>
  <li>libdnprofiler.so on UNIX system-based platforms other than Mac&reg; OS X.</li>
  <li>libdnprofiler.dylib on Mac OS X.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Building the Sample</h2>


<p>All samples are built from the buildall script.&nbsp;  </p>


<p>You can also build all the 
samples by switching to the root of the sample directory, sscli\samples, and typing 
<code>build -c</code>.</p>


<p>You can build this specific sample  by switching to the sample directory and typing 
<code>build -c</code>.</p>


<h2>Running the Sample</h2>


<p>These steps require that the Shared Source CLI (SSCLI) be already built and 
functional.</p>


<ol>
  <li>Run  env.bat or source the env.csh or env.sh script files, depending on 
  your platform.</li>
  <li>Switch to the %TARGETCOMPLUS%\samples\utilities\dnprofiler directory.</li>
  <li>Run the profiling_on.bat batch file to set up the required profiling 
  environment variables.</li>
  <li>Use the clix application launcher to run any managed application.</li>
  <li>A profiler output file called DNProfiler.out will be created in the 
  %TARGETCOMPLUS% directory. Open this file to read profiling 
  information.</li>
  <li>To modify the level of profiling information, edit the profiler_on.bat or 
  profiler_on.sh file to change the DN_PROFILER_MASK environment variable to 
  contain the various flag values in the commented region of the file. For 
  example, to only log class log transitions from managed to unmanaged code:<blockquote>
    <p>set DN_PROFILER_MASK=0x800</p>
  </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>To turn profiling off, use the profiling_off.bat.&nbsp; </li>
</ol>


<p>The profiler flag values are defined in sscli\palrt\idl\corprof.h.</p>


<h3>Issues</h3>

 
<ul>
  <li>Do not attempt to build the SSCLI with the profiler environment variables 
  set. This will result in build errors.</li>
  <li>Remember to copy or rename the DNProfiler.out file before running another 
  application, because the file will be overwritten.</li>
  <li>Do not keep the DNProfiler.out file open when running an application 
  because if the file cannot be opened with write access it will cause an 
  exception in the SSCLI.</li>
</ul>
