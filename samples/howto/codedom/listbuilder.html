<h1>ListBuilder CodeDOM Sample</h1>


<h2>Sample Overview</h2>


<p>This sample demonstrates how to use the code document object model (DOM) to generate a strongly typed 
collection.</p>


<h3>Using the CodeDOM to Emit Source Code</h3>


  <h4>What is the CodeDOM</h4>
  <p>The CodeDOM is an API that gives you the ability to create a programming 
  structure of namespaces, objects, and programming constructs by adding items 
  to different collections. All CodeDOM programs start out with the creation of 
  an <b>ICodeGenerator</b> for the target language. The following code shows the 
  creation of the <b>ICodeGenerator</b> for C#. </p>


  <blockquote>
      <pre>ICodeGenerator cg =new CSharpCodeProvider().CreateGenerator();
 ...
CSharpCodeProvider cdp = new CSharpCodeProvider();
cg = cdp.CreateGenerator();
</pre>
      </blockquote>
  <p>The <b>ICodeGenerator</b> is used to generate the actual code after a 
  CodeDOM tree is built. To begin building your tree, you need to start with a
  <b>CodeNamespace</b> object. This object will contain any types and import 
  directives.&nbsp;In 
  the sample, several <b>CodeNamespaceImport</b> objects are used to 
  generate import directives for commonly used namespaces. The sample also needs 
  to generate a class construct  by using a <b>CodeTypeDeclaration</b> and 
  setting the <b>IsClass</b> property to <b>true</b>. The following code demonstrates 
  these concepts. </p>
  <blockquote>
      <pre>CodeNamespace cnamespace = new CodeNamespace(&quot;Microsoft.Samples&quot;);
cnamespace.Imports.Add (new CodeNamespaceImport (&quot;System&quot;) );
 ...
CodeTypeDeclaration co = new CodeTypeDeclaration (typeName +&quot;List&quot;);
co.IsClass = true;
cnamespace.Types.Add (co);
</pre>
      </blockquote>
  <p>At the end of the previous example, the class type definition is added to 
  the <b>Types</b> collection of the <b>CodeNamespace</b> object. This is how a 
  CodeDOM tree is built. Starting with a <b>CodeNamespace</b> object and working 
  down through classes to class members. Class members in turn contain different 
  types of code statements and expressions. Once the entire tree is built, the 
  entire source tree can be written with a call to <b>GenerateCodeFromNamespace</b>, 
  a method on <b>ICodeGenerator</b>. The method is being passed the <b>
  CodeNamespace</b> object and a <b>TextWriter</b>. </p>
  <blockquote>
  <pre>baseCompiler.GenerateCodeFromNamespace (cnamespace, w, null);</pre>
      </blockquote>
  <p>The ListBuilder sample demonstrates the techniques described above by 
  generating the code for a strongly typed List. It also contains additional 
  information and code for generating code statements and expressions that were 
  left out of the  documentation above for brevity.


<h2>Sample Source and Build Output Locations</h2>


<p>The sample source is found in sscli\samples\howto\codedom.&nbsp; </p>


<p>The source file is:</p>


<ul class="none">
  <li><a href="listbuilder.cs">listbuilder.cs</a></li>
</ul>


<p>The build output location is %TARGETCOMPLUS%\samples\howto\codedom. The output file is an executable assembly named listbuilder.exe.</p>


<h2>Building the Sample</h2>


<p>All samples are built from the buildall script.&nbsp;  </p>


<p>You can also build all the 
samples by switching to the root of the sample directory, sscli\samples, and typing 
<code>build -c</code>.</p>


<p>You can run this specific sample  by switching to the sample directory and typing 
<code>build -c</code>.</p>


<h2>Running the Sample</h2>


<p>These steps require that the Shared Source CLI (SSCLI) be already built and 
functional.</p>


<ol>
  <li>Run  env.bat or source the env.csh or env.sh script files depending on 
  your platform.</li>
  <li>Switch to the %TARGETCOMPLUS%\samples\howto\codedom directory.</li>
  <li>Type the following command:<blockquote>


<p>clix listbuilder.exe</p>


  </blockquote>


  </li>
</ol>
