<h1> XML Serialization Sample</h1>


<h2>Sample Overview</h2>


<p>This sample illustrates using the XSD utility and XML serialization to create 
in-memory objects that have been deserialized from XML files.</p>


<p>The sample consists of two elements:</p>


<ol>
  <li>The purchaseorder XSD file which will be built into the purchaseorder.dll 
  assembly by means of the XSD tool.</li>
  <li>The xmlserialize.cs source code, which will use the generated purchaseorder 
  assembly to create a type definition used to deserialize an XML file into an 
  object instance.&nbsp;The deserialized object instance will be modified and 
  then serialized back out to a different XML file with the modifications.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Sample Source and Build Output Locations</h2>


<p>The sample source is found in two directories under 
sscli\samples\howto\xmlserialization:</p>


<ul>
  <li>purchaseorder<ul>
    <li>Contains <a href="purchaseorder/purchaseorder.xsd">purchaseorder.xsd</a> 
    which is used by the XSD tool to create 
    purchaseorder.dll.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>xmlserialize<ul>
    <li>Contains <a href="xmlserialize/xmlserialize.cs">xmlserialize.cs</a> which is built into the sample application.</li>
    <li>Contains inputdata.xml which is used by the sample application to create 
    an instance of type PurchaseOrder.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>


<p>The build output location is %TARGETCOMPLUS%\samples\howto\xmlserialization.&nbsp; 
 
</p>


<p>The output files are:</p>


<ul>
  <li>purchaseorder.dll</li>
  <li>xmlserialize.exe</li>
</ul>


<p>The input file, inputdata.xml, is also copied to the 
%TARGETCOMPLUS%\samples\howto\xmlserialization directory.</p>


<p>The sample  displays the status of deserializing the object from the XML 
file and reserializing it.&nbsp;After  the sample runs, a new file named 
purchaseorder_serialized.xml will have been created in the 
%TARGETCOMPLUS%\samples\howto\xmlserialization directory.&nbsp;This file 
contains the modified content of the deserialized object instance.</p>


<h2>Building the Sample</h2>


<p>All samples are built from the buildall script.&nbsp;  </p>


<p>You can also build all the 
samples by switching to the root of the sample directory, sscli\samples, and typing 
<code>build -c</code>.</p>


<p>You can build this specific sample  by switching to the sample directory and typing 
<code>build -c</code>.</p>


<h2>Running the Sample</h2>


<p>These steps require that the Shared Source CLI (SSCLI) be already built and 
functional.</p>


<ol>
  <li>Run  env.bat or source the env.csh or env.sh script files, depending on 
  your platform.</li>
  <li>Switch to the %TARGETCOMPLUS%\samples\howto\xmlserialization directory.</li>
  <li>Type the following command:<blockquote>


<p>clix xmlserialize.exe</p>


  </blockquote>


  </li>
</ol>
