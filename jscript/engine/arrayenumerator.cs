/*
The indices in the dense part of an ArrayObject do not show up as properties in the field table of the object. This enumerator includes them in the enumeration.
It is complicated by the fact that properties can be added to both the dense part and the field table as the enumeration proceeds.

Another, major complication is that prior versions of JS enumerate properties in the order they were added to the object, and many test suites depend on this order.

When an array is stored densely, it does not make sense to retain the order in which indices were added to the array, merely to make enumerations work exactly as
they always have. However, some test at least, work if the numerical indices are listed before other properties, but numerical indices that are added after
other properties, are listed afterwards.
