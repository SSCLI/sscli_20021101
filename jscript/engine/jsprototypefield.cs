/*
An object with a prototype acts as if the properties of its prototype are its own. Any updates to the properties of the prototype are
visible via the object. However, if the property is assigned to via the object, the object makes a local copy of the property and all
further accesses via the object refer to the local copy, not the field of the prototype. Any further updates to the corresponding property
of the prototype will no longer be visible via the object. Likewise, updates via the object do not update the corresponding property on the prototype.

This class provides a wrapper for the fields of prototype properties that implements the desired behavior. When an object is queried for
a property and finds it in its prototype chain, it wraps the prototype property in one these and adds it to its field table. All future accesses
to the property resolve to this field.

Static fields and read only fields are not wrapped since they should not behave like instance fields.
