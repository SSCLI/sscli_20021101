<h1>Shared Source CLI Build Tools</h1>

<p>The tools below are used by the  Shared Source CLI (SSCLI) build process.&nbsp; These tools 
are intended for use with the SSCLI  build process and are only documented 
sufficiently for that purpose although they include more advanced 
functionality.</p>

<p>An overview of the SSCLI build process can be found in
<a href="building_sscli.html">building_sscli.html</a>.</p>

<p>The path to the root directory of the SSCLI source tree is designated below 
as sscli<i>, </i>which is the default root directory created when the archive is 
expanded<i>. </i>&nbsp;If the SSCLI source were unpacked on Microsoft&reg; Windows&reg;, 
this would represent a path such as C:\sscli.</p>
