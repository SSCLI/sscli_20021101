<h2><a name="Overview"></a>Overview</h2>

<p>The Microsoft&reg; Shared Source implementation of the C# compiler is very 
similar to the implementation in the Microsoft&reg; .NET Framework SDK and Microsoft&reg; Visual Studio&reg; 
.NET.&nbsp; Both&nbsp;implementations originate from the same source base but 
some options and features that rely on functionality in Microsoft&reg; Windows&reg; have 
been 
removed from the Shared Source implementation.</p>

<p>The application file for the C# compiler is named csc.exe on Windows and csc 
on UNIX system-based platforms.</p>

<h2><a name="ChangesintheSharedSourceCSharpImplementation"></a>Changes in the Shared Source C# Implementation</h2>

<p>The following option areas and related options were modified</p>

<ul>
  <li>No features using Windows resources are  supported.<ul>
    <li>Option removed: <b>/win32res</b>.</li>
    <li>Option removed: <b>/win32icon</b>.</li>
    <li>No resource file is automatically generated and embedded in the output 
    file.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Bug reporting is not supported.<ul>
    <li>Option removed: <b>/bugreport</b>.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Documentation generation is not supported. The .NET Framework 
  implementation of C# supports generation of XML documents from specifically 
  formatted comments.<ul>
  <li>Option removed: <b>/doc</b>.</li>
</ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Complete documentation for the .NET Framework C# compiler and tutorials is available on
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com">msdn.microsoft.com</a>.&nbsp;Other than the changes mentioned above, the functionality in the Shared Source 
implementation of the C# compiler is the same as the .NET Framework 
implementation.</p>

<p>Note: Because the C# compiler builds complete portable executable (PE) files (.exe 
files, .dll files, and 
.netmodule files) it can be considered a compiler and linker.&nbsp;The compiler has 
linker-style options that set Windows-specific information in the generated PE 
file.&nbsp;The Shared Source  CLI (SSCLI) loads applications using the
<a href="../tools/clix.html">clix</a> loader and does not use the Windows system 
loader.&nbsp;Windows-specific settings that affect file loading are ignored when 
files are loaded  into the SSCLI.&nbsp; However, if an assembly built 
with the Shared Source implementation of the C# compiler 
is executed under the .NET Framework, the file is first loaded by the system 
loader and the information in the PE file does change the Windows PE file 
loading behavior.&nbsp; The Shared Source C# compiler does make the required 
modifications to the PE file but these changes are only used by the Windows 
loader and not by the clix loader.</p>

<p>Some of the options to which this note applies are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>baseaddress</li>
  <li>filealign</li>
  <li>target</li>
</ul>

<h2><font face="verdana">
<a name="CSharpCommandLine"></a>C# Command Line</font></h2>

<P>The compiler produces PE format executable (.exe) files, dynamic-link 
libraries (DLLs), or code modules (.netmodule files).&nbsp;For information on the PE format of files loaded by ECMA CLI implementations see 
the ECMA-335 Common Language Infrastructure specification, Partition II, section 
24.</P>

<P>For information on how the Shared Source CLI (SSCLI) implementation loads PE files, see the 
implementation code for the <a href="../tools/clix.html">clix</a> application 
loader: sscli\clr\src\tools\clix.&nbsp;Also see sscli\clr\src\vm\cormap.cpp for the PE loader implementation.</P>

<P>The C# compiler can be invoked at the command line by typing the name of the 
executable file on the command line. For more details on correctly setting your environment to build and execute 
SSCLI utilities including the C# compiler, see <a href="../buildtools/env.html">env.html</a></P>

<h3><a name="RulesforCommand-LineSyntax"></a>Rules for Command-Line Syntax</h3>

<P>The C# compiler code uses the following rules when interpreting arguments given on the operating system command line:

<UL>
	<LI>Arguments are delimited by white space, which is either a space or a tab.</li>

	<LI>A string surrounded by double quotation marks ("string") is interpreted as a single argument, regardless of 
    any white space contained within. A quoted string can be embedded in an argument.</li>

	<LI>A double quotation mark preceded by a backslash (\") is interpreted as a literal double quotation mark character (").</li>

	<LI>Backslashes are interpreted literally, unless they immediately precede a double quotation mark.</li>

	<LI>If an even number of backslashes is followed by a double quotation mark, one backslash is placed in the argv array for every pair of backslashes, and the double quotation mark is interpreted as a string delimiter.</li>

	<LI>If an odd number of backslashes is followed by a double quotation mark, one backslash is placed in the argv array for every pair of backslashes, and the double quotation mark is "escaped" by the remaining backslash, causing a literal double quotation mark (") to be placed in argv.</li>
</UL>


<h3><a name="CSharpCompilerOptions"></a>C# Compiler Options</h3>

<P>Every compiler option is available in two forms: <B>-option</B> and <B>/option</B>.</P>

<P>Note: To avoid&nbsp;ambiguity on UNIX system-based platforms between file names 
that contain the '/'  character and the <B><i>/</i>option</B> 
form, use the <B>-option</B> form instead.</P>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width="25%"><b>@</b><i>response_file</i></TD>
<TD width="75%" colspan="2">Specifies a response file, <i>response_file.</i><p>The 
<b>@ </b>option lets you specify a file that contains compiler options and source code 
files to compile. These compiler options and source code files will be processed 
by the compiler just as if they had been specified on the command line.<br>
<br>
To specify more than one response file in a compilation, specify multiple 
response file options. <p>For example:<blockquote>
  <p><br>
@file1.rsp @file2.rsp</blockquote>
<p><br>
In a response file, multiple compiler options and source code files can appear 
on one line. A single compiler option specification must appear on one line 
(it cannot span multiple lines). Response files can have comments that begin with 
the # symbol.<br>
<br>
Specifying compiler options from within a response file is just like issuing 
those commands on the command line. <br>
<br>
The compiler processes the command options as they are encountered. Therefore, 
command-line arguments can override previously listed options in response files. 
Conversely, options in a response file will override options listed previously 
on the command line or in other response files.</TD>

<TD width="25%"><b>/addmodule:</b><i>file[;file2]</i></TD>
<TD width="75%" colspan="2">Specifies one or more modules (<i>file, file2,</i> and 
so on<i>)</i> to be part of this assembly.<p>
All modules added with <b>/addmodule </b>must be in the same directory as the output 
file at run time. That is, you can specify a module in any directory at compile 
time but the module must be in the application directory at run time. If the 
module is not in the application directory at run time, you will get a 
System.TypeLoadException.<br>
<br>
<i>file</i> cannot contain an assembly. For example, if the output file was 
created with <b>/target:</b><i>module</i>, its metadata can be imported with<b> /addmodule</b>.<br>
<br>
If the output file was created with a <b>/target</b> option other than <b>/target:</b><i>module</i>, 
its metadata cannot be imported with /addmodule but can be imported with 
<b>/reference</b>.</TD>

<TD width="25%"><b>/baseaddress:</b><i>address_value</i></TD>
<TD width="75%" colspan="2">Specifies the preferred base address (<i>address_value)</i> at which to load a 
DLL.&nbsp; 
<p>The loading base address is only relevant if the file is going to be run on 
the  .NET Framework on Windows.&nbsp; Differences in loading behavior 
can occur in the .NET Framework on Windows depending on the version of the 
Windows operating system.</p>
<p>The SSCLI implementation ignores base address information stored in the PE 
assembly file.&nbsp; For details on how the SSCLI implementation loads PE files 
see sscli\clr\src\vm\cormap.cpp.</p>
<p>For information on the PE format of files loaded by ECMA CLI implementations

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width="25%"><b>/checked[+ | -]</b></TD>
<TD width="75%" colspan="2">Specifies whether integer arithmetic that overflows the bounds of the data type will cause an exception at run time.<p>
The <b>/checked</b> option specifies whether an integer arithmetic statement that is 
not in the scope of the checked or unchecked keywords and that results in a 
value outside the range of the data type shall cause a run-time exception.<br>
<br>
An integer arithmetic statement that is in the scope of the checked or unchecked 
keywords is not subject to the effect of the <b>/checked</b> option.<br>
<br>
If an integer arithmetic statement that is not in the scope of the checked or 
unchecked keywords results in a value outside the range of the data type, and 
<b>/checked+</b> (the default if an option is not specified) is used in the compilation, then 
that statement will cause an exception at run time. If <b>/checked-</b> is used in the 
compilation, then that statement will not cause an exception at run time.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width="25%"><b>/codepage:</b><i>id</i></TD>
<TD width="75%" colspan="2">Specifies the code page to use for all source code files

files that were not created to use the default code page on your computer, you 
can use the -codepage option to specify which code page should be used.<br>
<br>
If the source code files were created with the same codepage that is in effect 
on your computer or if the source code files were created with UNICODE or UTF-8, 
you need not use <b>/codepage</b>.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width="25%"><b>/debug[+ | -]</b><br>
<b>/debug:</b>{full | pdbonly}</TD>
<TD width="75%" colspan="2">Emits debugging information.<p>The <b>/debug</b> option causes 
the compiler to generate debugging information and place it in the output 
file. Use this option to create debug builds. If /debug, /debug+, or 
/debug:full is not specified, you will not be able to  debug the 
output assembly at the source code level.</p>
<p>Options values:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>+ | - </b> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Specifying +, or just <b>/debug</b>, causes the compiler to generate debugging 
information and place it in a program database (.ildb file). Specifying -, which 
is in effect if you do not specify <b>/debug</b>, prevents debug information 
from being 
created. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>full | pdbonly </b> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>These arguments specify the type of debugging information generated by the compiler. The 
full argument, which is in effect if you do not specify <b>/debug:pdbonly</b>, enables 
attaching a debugger to the running program. Specifying <b>pdbonly</b> allows source 
code debugging when the program is started in the debugger, but will  display CIL 
only when the running program is attached to the debugger. </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width="25%"><b>/define:</b><i>name[;name2]</i></TD>
<TD width="75%" colspan="2">Defines preprocessor symbols where <i>name </i>and<i> name2</i> 
are the names of one or more symbols that you want to define. <br>
&nbsp;<p>The <b>/define</b> option defines <i>name</i> as a symbol in your program. It has the 
same effect as using a <b>#define</b> preprocessor directive in your source file. A 
symbol remains defined until an <b>#undef </b>directive in the source file removes the 
definition or the compiler reaches the end of the file.<br>
<br>
You can use symbols created by this option with <b>#if</b>, <b>#else</b>, <b>#elif</b>, and 
<b>#endif </b>to 
compile source files conditionally.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The short form of <b>/define</b> is <b>/d</b>.</p>
<p>You can define multiple symbols with /define by using a semicolon or comma to 
separate symbol names. </p>
<p>For example:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>/define:</b>DEBUG;TUESDAY</p>
</blockquote>
</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width="25%"><b>/filealign:</b><i>number</i></TD>
<TD width="75%" colspan="2">Specifies the size of sections in the output binary file where
<i>number</i> has values of 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, or 16384. These values are in 
bytes. 
<p>The information stored in the PE file as the result of using this option is 
not used on the SSCLI implementation of the CLI assembly loader. This 
option is 
only  meaningful if the file is going to be loaded in the Microsoft .NET 
Framework on Windows.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width="25%"><b>/fullpaths</b></TD>
<TD width="75%" colspan="2">Specifies the absolute path to the file in compiler output.<p>
By default, errors and warnings that result from compilation specify the name of 
the file in which an error was found. The <b>/fullpaths</b> option causes the compiler 
to specify the full path to the file.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width="25%"><b>/help</b></TD>
<TD width="75%" colspan="2">Outputs compiler options to the console.&nbsp; Same as 
<b>/?</b>.<p>This option sends a list of compiler options, and a brief description of 
each option, to stdout. If this option is included in a compilation, no output 
file will be created and no compilation will take place.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width="25%"><b>/incremental[+ | -]</b></TD>
<TD width="75%" colspan="2">Enables incremental compilation of source code files.<p>
The <b>/incremental</b> compiler option enables the incremental compiler, which 
compiles only those methods that have changed since the last compilation. 
Information about the state of the previous compilation is stored in the 
following file, which is created by the compiler: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>output_file_name.dbg </p>
</blockquote>
<p>When compiling with <b>/debug</b>, the status of debug information is stored in the 
program database (.ildb file). </p>
<p>Information about the status of the compilation, other than debug 
information, is stored in an .incr file.&nbsp;For example:<blockquote>
<p>output_file_name.extension.incr
</blockquote>
<p> <br>
The first time you use <b>/incremental</b>, the .incr and .ildb files are fully updated and 
all subsequent compilations will be incremental. Changing the compiler options 
from the previous <b>/incremental</b> compilation will cause a full rebuild of the 
.incr and .ildb files.<br>
<br>
If the compiler detects many changes since the last incremental build, it might 
perform a full build, as a full build would be at least as efficient as an 
incremental build. If the compiler cannot find the project's .ildb or .incr 
files, a full rebuild will occur.<br>
<br>
By default, <b>/incremental-</b> is in effect. Specifying <b>/incremental</b> is the same as 
specifying <b>/incremental+</b>.<br>
<br>
Output files created with the <b>/incremental</b> option might be larger than those 
created with incremental compilation disabled. Because the output files can be 
larger, you should use <b>/incremental-</b> in the final build of your output file.<br>
<br>
This option will speed compilation on projects with many, smaller files, and 
will have little or no speed improvement on projects with a few large files.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width="25%"><b>/lib:</b><i>dir1[, dir2]</i></TD>
<TD width="75%" colspan="2">Specifies the location of assemblies that will be referenced 
through the <b>/reference</b> option 
where <i>dir1 </i>is a directory for the compiler to look in if a referenced 
assembly is not found in the current working directory (the directory from which 
you are invoking the compiler) or in the CLI implementation assembly directory 
and <i>dir2</i> is one or more additional directories to search in to resolve assembly 
references. 
<p>Separate additional directory names with a comma.  
<p>The <b>/lib</b> option specifies the location of assemblies referenced through the 
<b>/reference</b> option.<br>
<br>
The compiler searches for assembly references that are not fully qualified in 
the following order: 
<ol>
  <li>The current working directory. This is the directory from which the compiler 
  is invoked. </li>
  <li>The common language runtime system directory. </li>
  <li>Directories specified by <b>/lib</b>. </li>
  <li>Directories specified by the LIB environment variable. </li>
  </ol>
<p>Use <b>/reference </b>to specify an assembly reference.<br>
<br>
<b>/lib</b> is additive; specifying it more than once appends to any prior values.<br>
<br>
An alternative to using <b>/lib</b> is to copy into the working directory any required 
assemblies; this will allow you to simply pass the assembly name to <b>/reference</b>. 
After compilation you can  delete the assemblies from the working 
directory. Since the assembly references store only the assembly name and  do 
not specify a path, the application can be started on the target computer and 
will find and use the assembly in the global assembly cache.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width="25%"><b>/linkresource:</b><i>filename[,identifier]</i></TD>
<TD width="75%" colspan="2">Creates a link to a managed resource where <i>filename</i> 
is the resource file to which you want to link from the assembly and <i>
identifier</i> (optional) is the logical name for the resource (the name used in 
code to load the resource).<p>The default identifier is  the file 
name. <p>The <b>/linkresource</b> option creates a link to a resource in the output 
file; the resource file is not placed in the output file. The <b>/resource</b> option 
embeds a resource file in the output file.<br>
<br>
Linked resources are public in the assembly when created with the C# compiler.<br>
<br>
<b>/linkresource</b> requires one of the /target options other than <b>/target</b>:<i>module</i>.<br>
<br>
If <i>filename</i> is a .resource file created by resgen.exe or in the 
development environment, for example, it can be accessed with members in the <b>System.Resources</b> 
namespace. For all other resources, use the <b>GetManifestResource</b>* methods in the 
<b>System.Reflection.Assembly </b>class to access the resource at run time.<br>
<br>
<b>/linkres</b> is the short form of <b>/linkresource</b>.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width="25%"><b>/main:</b><i>class</i></TD>
<TD width="75%" colspan="2">Specifies the location of the <b>Main</b> method where <i>class</i> 
is the type that contains the <b>Main</b> method. <br>
<br>
If your compilation includes more than one type with a <b>Main</b> method, the 
<b>/main</b> 
option allows you to specify which type contains the <b>Main</b> method that you want 
to use as the entry point into the program.<br>
<br>
This option is only for use when compiling an .exe file.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width="25%"><b>/nologo</b></TD>
<TD width="75%" colspan="2">Suppresses compiler banner information.<p>The <b>/nologo</b> 
option suppresses the display of the sign-on banner when the compiler starts up and 
suppresses the display of informational messages during compiling.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width="25%"><b>/nostdlib[+ | -]</b></TD>
<TD width="75%" colspan="2">Prevents the default importation of the base class library (mscorlib.dll).<p>The 
<b>/nostdlib</b> option prevents the import of mscorlib.dll, which defines the entire 
System namespace. Use this option if you want to define or create your own 
System namespace and objects.</p>
<p>This option is used by the SSCLI build system in order to bootstrap the build 
of the base class libraries in mscorlib.dll.<br>
<br>
If you do not specify <b>/nostdlib</b>, mscorlib.dll will be imported into your program 
just as when you specify <b>/nostdlib-</b>. If you specify <b>/nostdlib</b>, it is the same as 
specifying <b>/nostdlib+</b>.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width="25%"><b>/noconfig</b></TD>
<TD width="75%" colspan="2">Prevents compilation with the global or local versions of csc.rsp.<p>
The <b>/noconfig</b> option tells the compiler not to compile with the global or local 
versions of csc.rsp.<br>
<br>
By default, the C# compiler looks in the compiler directory and then in the 
directory from which the compiler was invoked for files called csc.rsp.<br>
<br>
The csc.rsp file that is supplied in the compiler directory references the .NET 
Framework assemblies that would be included in a C# project created in the 
Visual Studio .NET development environment. You can modify this global csc.rsp file 
to contain any other compiler options that you want to include in a compilation 
from the command line with csc.exe.<br>
<br>
The compiler will then look for a csc.rsp file in the directory from which the 
compiler was invoked. The commands in the local csc.rsp file will be combined 
with the global csc.rsp file for the compilation. Because the global csc.rsp is 
processed first, any command that is also in the local csc.rsp file will 
override the setting of the same command in the global csc.rsp file.<br>
<br>
Finally, the compiler will read the options passed to the csc command. Because 
these are processed last, any option on the command line will override a setting 
of the same option in either of the csc.rsp files.<br>
<br>
If you do not want the compiler to look for and use the settings in the global 
and local csc.rsp files, specify <b>/noconfig</b>.</TD>

<TD width="25%"><b>/nowarn:</b><i>number1[,number2[...]]</i></TD>
<TD width="75%" colspan="2">Suppresses the compiler's ability to generate 
specified warnings where <i>number1 </i>and<i> number2</i> are warning numbers that you 
want the compiler to suppress. <p>The <b>/nowarn</b> option lets you suppress the 
compiler's ability to generate one or more warnings. Separate multiple warning 
numbers with a comma.<br>
<br>
You  need to specify only the numeric part of the warning identifier. For 
example, if you want to suppress CS0028, you could specify <b>/nowarn:</b>28.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width="25%"><b>/optimize[+ | -]</b></TD>
<TD width="75%" colspan="2">Enables or disables optimizations.<p>The <b>/optimize</b> option 
enables or disables optimizations performed by the compiler to make your output 
file smaller, faster, and more efficient. <b>/optimize</b> also tells the common 
language runtime to optimize code at runtime.<br>
<br>
By default, <b>/optimize</b> is in effect. Specifying <b>/optimize</b> is the equivalent to 
specifying <b>/optimize+</b>.<br>
<br>
All references (see <b>/reference</b>) in an assembly must have the same optimization 
settings.<br>
<br>
To prevent the compiler from generating an optimized output file, specify 
<b>/optimize-</b>.<br>
<br>
<b>/o</b> is the short form of <b>/optimize</b>.<br>
<br>
It is possible to combine the <b>/optimize</b> and <b>/debug</b> options.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width="25%"><b>/out:</b><i>filename</i></TD>
<TD width="75%" colspan="2">Specifies the output file where <i>filename</i> is the 
name of the output file created by the compiler. 
<p>The <b>/out</b> option specifies the name of the output file. The compiler expects 
to find one or more source code files following the <b>/out</b> option.<br>
<br>
If you do not specify the name of the output file: </p>
<ul>
  <li>An .exe file will take its name from the source code file that contains the 
  Main method. </li>
  <li>A .dll or .netmodule file will take its name from the first source code file.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>On the command line, it is possible to specify multiple output files for your 
compilation. All source code files specified after an /out option will be 
compiled into the output file specified by that /out option. A source code file 
used to compile one output file cannot be used in the same compilation to 
compile another output file.<br>
<br>
Specify the full name and extension of the file you want to create.</TD>

begin and <i>file</i> is the file or files to search for. Wildcard characters are 
allowed. 
<p>If <i>dir</i> is not specified, the search begins in the directory where the csc 
command was executed.</p>
<p>The <b>/recurse</b> option lets you compile source code files in all child 
directories of either the specified directory (dir) or the directory where the 
csc command was executed.<br>
<br>
You can use wildcard characters in a file name to compile all matching files in the 
project directory without using <b>/recurse</b>.</TD>

and<i> 
file2</i> are one or more files  containing an assembly manifest. To import 
more than one file, separate file names with either a comma or a semicolon.
<p>The <b>/reference</b> option causes the compiler to make public type information in 
the specified files available to the project you are currently compiling.<br>
<br>
The file or files you import must contain a manifest; the output file must have been 
compiled with one of the <b>/target</b> options other than <b>/target:module</b>.<br>
<br>
Use <b>/addmodule</b> to import metadata from an output file that does not contain an 
assembly manifest.<br>
<br>
Although executable files can be referenced as assemblies it is not recommended 
that shared, referenced code be stored in executable assemblies.&nbsp;Instead, 
place the shared code in an assembly library.<br>

If you reference an assembly (Assembly A), which itself references another 
assembly (Assembly B), you will need to reference Assembly B if: </p>
<ul>
  <li>A type you use from Assembly A inherits from a type or implements an 
  interface from Assembly B. </li>
  <li>You invoke a field, property, event, or method that has a return type 
  or parameter type from Assembly B. </li>
</ul>
<p>Use <b>/lib </b>to specify the directory in which one or more of your assembly 
references is located. The <b>/lib</b> topic also discusses which directories the 
compiler searches for assemblies.<br>
<br>
<b>/r</b> is the short form of <b>/reference</b>.</TD>

<TD width="75%" colspan="2">Embeds a .NET Framework resource into the output file 
where <i>filename</i> is the SSCLI resource file you want to embed in the output

<p>The default identifier is  the file name. </p>
<p>Use <b>/linkresource </b>to link a resource to an assembly rather than placing the

<br>
Resources are public in the assembly when created with the C# compiler.<br>
<br>
If <i>filename</i> is an SSCLI resource file created, for example, by resgen.exe, it can be accessed with members in the 
<b>System.Resources</b> namespace (for more information see <b>System.Resources.ResourceManager</b>). For all other resources, use the

<TD width="25%" rowspan="5"><b>/target:</b><i>output_type</i></TD>
<TD width="75%" colspan="2">Specifies the type of assembly to be generated by 
the compiler.<p>Unless you specify <b>/target:module</b>, <b>/target</b> causes assembly 
metadata to be placed in an output file.<br>
<br>
The assembly manifest is placed in the first .exe output file in the compilation 
or in the first DLL, if there is no EXE output file. For example, in the 
following command line, the manifest will be placed in 1.exe:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>csc <b>/out:</b>1.exe t1.cs <b>/out:</b>2.netmodule t2.cs</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The compiler creates only one assembly manifest per compilation. Information 
about all files in a compilation is placed in the assembly metadata. All output 
files except those created with <b>/target:</b>module can contain an assembly manifest. 
When producing multiple output files at the command line, only one assembly 
manifest can be created and it must go into the first output file specified on 
the command line. If the first output file is an executable assembly 
(<b>/target:</b><i>exe</i> or <b>/target:</b><i>winexe</i>) or code library (<b>/target</b>:<i>library</i>), then any 
other output files produced in the same compilation must be modules 
(<b>/target:</b><i>module</i>).<br>
<br>
If you create an assembly, you can indicate that all or part of your code is CLS-compliant with the 
<b>CLSCompliant</b> attribute.</p>
<p>Specify the format of the output file using one of four options:</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width="1%">
<b>/target:</b><i>exe</i></TD>
<TD width="160%">The <b>/target:</b><i>exe</i> option causes the compiler to create an executable 
(EXE), console application. The /target:exe option is in effect by default. The 
executable file will be created with the .exe extension.<br>
<br>
Unless otherwise specified with the /out option, the output file name takes the 
name of the input file that contains the Main method.<br>
<br>
When specified at the command line, all files up to the next <b>/out</b>, 
<b>/target:</b><i>winexe</i>, or <b>/target:</b><i>library</i> option are used to create the .exe file. The 
<b>/target:</b><i>exe</i> option is in effect for all files following the previous /out or 
/target:library option.<br>
<br>
One and only one <b>Main</b> method is required in the source code files that are 
compiled into an .exe file. The <b>/main</b> compiler option lets you specify which 
class contains the <b>Main</b> method, in cases where your code has more than one class 
with a <b>Main</b> method.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width="1%">
<b>/target:</b><i>library</i></TD>
<TD width="160%">The <b>/target:</b><i>library</i> option causes the compiler to create a 
dynamic-link library (DLL) rather than an executable file (EXE). The DLL will be 
created with the .dll extension.<br>
<br>
Unless otherwise specified with the <b>/out</b> option, the output file name takes the 
name of the first input file.<br>
<br>
When specified at the command line, all files up to the next <b>/out</b>, 
<b>/target:</b><i>winexe</i>, or <b>/target:</b><i>exe</i> option are used to create the .dll file.<br>
<br>
When building a .dll file, a <b>Main</b> method is not required.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width="1%">
<b>/target:</b><i>module</i></TD>
<TD width="160%">To prevent generation of an assembly manifest, use the /target:module 
option. By default, the output file will have a .netmodule extension.<br>
<br>
A file that does not have an assembly manifest cannot be directly loaded by the 
SSCLI execution engine. However, such a file can be incorporated into the 
assembly manifest of an assembly using the <b>/addmodule</b> option.<br>
<br>
If more than one module is created in a single compilation, internal types in 
one module will be available to other modules in the compilation. When code in 
one module references <b>internal</b> types in another module, then both modules 
must be incorporated into an assembly manifest, using <b>/addmodule</b>.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width="1%">
<b>/target:</b><i>winexe</i></TD>
<TD width="160%">The <b>/target:winexe </b>option causes the compiler to create an 
executable  Windows GUI application. The executable file will be created 
with the .exe extension. This sets the subsystem information in the PE file 
that is used by  Windows to determine some execution characteristics 
of the application.<p>This information is ignored by the SSCLI implementation of 
the CLI.&nbsp;However, if the application is executed under the  .NET 
Framework this option will be significant.&nbsp;For more information on the 
console or Windows subsystem setting see <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com">http://msdn.microsoft.com</a> and search for 
&quot;console subsystem&quot;.<br>
<br>
Use <b>/target:</b><i>exe</i> to create a console application. <br>
<br>
Unless otherwise specified with the <b>/out</b> option, the output file name takes the 
name of the input file that contains the <b>Main</b> method.<br>
<br>
When specified at the command line, all files until the next <b>/out</b> or <b>/target</b> 
option are used to create the Windows application.<br>
<br>
Only one <b>Main</b> method is required in the source code files that are compiled into 
an .exe file. The /main option lets you specify which class contains the <b>Main</b> 
method, in the case where your code has more than one class with a static <b>Main</b> 
method.</TD>

<TD width="25%"><b>/warnaserror[+ | -]</b></TD>
<TD width="75%" colspan="2">Promotes warnings to errors.<p>The <b>/warnaserror+</b> 
option treats all warnings as errors. Any messages that would ordinarily be 
reported as warnings are instead reported as errors, and the build process is 
halted (no output files are built). <br>
<br>
By default, <b>/warnaserror-</b> is in effect and causes warnings to permit the 
generation of an output file. <b>/warnaserror</b>, which is equivalent to <b>/warnaserror+</b>, 
causes warnings to be treated as errors.<br>
<br>
Use <b>/warn</b> to specify the level of warnings that you want the compiler to 
display.</TD>
