<h2><a name="SSCLIAssemblyKeys"></a>SSCLI Assembly Keys</h2>
<p>The Shared Source CLI (SSCLI) runtime is not intended for use as a secure 
environment, although its source code does provide a good example of how a 
secure execution environment can be implemented. By default, strong name 
verification is turned off for several important public keys. </p>
<p>The implementation of the global assembly cache and strong name verification 
system in the SSCLI is completely separate from the implementation used by the 
commercial Microsoft&reg; .NET Framework, and because of this, there should be no 
interaction between the two. Turning off strong name verification in the SSCLI 
will not impact the .NET Framework on Microsoft&reg; Windows&reg; in any way. </p>
<h3>What is Strong Name Verification?</h3>
<p>Strong name verification is a mechanism that requires a developer or 
publisher of an assembly to have access to both the public and private elements 
of a cryptographic key pair at build time. The public key becomes part of the 
assembly name and a cryptographic hash of the metadata of the assembly is 
calculated using the private key and inserted into the assembly. At load time, 
strong name verification uses the public key to derive the metadata checksum 
that can be checked against the actual metadata thus proving that the producer 
of the assembly had access to the private key. More information on this process 
can be obtained from <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com">msdn.microsoft.com</a>. The implementation of strong 
name verification can be seen in the SSCLI source tree in 
<a href="../clr/src/dlls/mscorsn/strongname.cpp">sscli\clr\src\dlls\mscorsn\strongname.cpp</a>. </p>
<h3>The ECMA Special Key</h3>
<p>There is an additional distinction among strong names. All assemblies 
released in the .NET Framework that include classes specified in the ECMA-335 
CLI standard are name with a special public key. This public key is 
cryptographically invalid and is treated as a special case by both the SSCLI and 
the .NET Framework strong name verification code. </p>
<p>In Microsoft's commercial .NET Framework implementation, when an assembly 
using this special public key is loaded, the strong name verification code  assumes that the assembly is signed using the private Microsoft key. If it is not 
signed with the Microsoft key then the assembly will not load unless strong name 
verification for the public key in that assembly is turned off. </p>
<p>In the SSCLI, when an assembly contains the special public key designated by 
ECMA, the strong name verification code  assumes that the assembly is signed 
with the SSCLI private key, which can be found in 
sscli\clr\bin\bin\finalpublickey.snk. If it is not signed with the SSCLI private key, 
the assembly will not load unless strong name verification for the public key of 
that assembly is turned off. By default, the build process delay-signs all 
assemblies.</p>
<p>Note that the SSCLI private key is not in any sense a &quot;private&quot; key because 
it is published in the source distribution. Anyone can use it to sign any 
assembly and it signifies nothing with respect to security and ownership of the 
resulting binary. </p>
<h3>Source-code Distribution Implies Delayed Signing</h3>
<p>Because the SSCLI distribution is a source distribution with a build process 
and because the private key used to sign the .NET Framework implementation of 
system assemblies can be used only for signing binary files published by 
Microsoft,  assemblies built during the SSCLI build process on your computer 
are  delay-signed. </p>
<p>Delay signing (also called &quot;partial signing&quot;) means that the public key is 
stored in the assembly metadata but the assembly file is not signed using the 
private key. In order for a delay-signed assembly to load, strong name 
verification must be turned off. This is done using the Strong Name tool during 
the SSCLI build process (see <a href="tools/sn.html">sn.html</a>). The default 
configuration for the SSCLI build environment is that verification is turned off 
for both the ECMA public key and the Microsoft public key. </p>
<p>All assemblies that can be found in both the SSCLI and in Microsoft's 
commercial .NET Framework use identical public keys: some contain the ECMA key 
and some contain the Microsoft public key. Note that no assembly built with 
the SSCLI key can be trusted with respect to origin, including assemblies built 
during the SSCLI build process. (Of course, you have control of the SSCLI source code 
on your computer, so you understand the level of trust to impart to your own build output.) </p>
<p>When an assembly B references an assembly A, compilers  store the full 
assembly identity, including the public key, in the assembly reference in 
assembly B. When either the SSCLI or the commercial .NET Framework load assembly 
B and attempt to resolve the types that reside in assembly A, the 
assembly-loading infrastructure will only look for assemblies with the same 
public key as assembly A. Note that no information with respect to the 
cryptographic signature of assembly A is stored in assembly B - only the public 
key (usually a size-reduced hash of the public key). Cryptographic verification 
occurs when an assembly is loaded into the CLI execution environment. Thus, 
assemblies built against delay-signed assemblies are no different than 
assemblies built against fully signed assemblies, only the public key is 
transferred to the new assembly. </p>
<p>The SSCLI&nbsp; implementation is designed to facilitate sharing code and 
experimentation. Code built against one SSCLI installation should run against 
another SSCLI installation. It should also run against other ECMA 335-compliant 
CLI implementations, assuming only classes in the ECMA standard are used. No 
assumptions should be made, however, about the security of the SSCLI 
installation or of assembly code signed with the SSCLI key pair. </p>
<h3>Strong Names and SSCLI Tools</h3>
<p>Some tools in the SSCLI are managed applications that must be run inside the 
SSCLI execution environment. This means they must be executed using the
<a href="tools/clix.html">clix</a> application launching utility.&nbsp; Managed 
applications are assemblies and in the SSCLI these assemblies are delay signed.&nbsp; 
Failure to use the clix launcher to execute an SSCLI managed tool on Windows 
will cause the tool to be executed under the .NET Framework.&nbsp; This will 
cause an error dialog box that states that the utility might have been tampered 
with or was partially signed.&nbsp; This error is correct: the SSCLI utilities 
are partially signed and will not execute under the .NET Framework.</p>
<p>For example, if you forget to run <code>clix caspol</code> on Windows and instead just 
run <code>caspol</code> you could see the resulting error dialog box content:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>caspol.exe - Strong name validation failed.<br>
Strong name validation failed for assembly 
'C:\sscli\build\v1.x86fstchk.rotor\caspol.exe'. The file may have been 
tampered with or it was partially signed but not fully signed with the correct 
private key.&nbsp;</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>If you see a similar error, make sure to use the clix launcher when 
executing that tool.</p>
<h3>Changing the Default Key Value Using the Keyconfig Tool</h3>
<p>You can use the sample tool, keyconfig, to change the key used by the SSCLI 
when it builds.&nbsp; See
<a href="../samples/utilities/keyconfig/keyconfig.html">keyconfig.html</a> for 
more information on using this tool.</p>
<p>When you use this tool, you will be providing a custom assembly key pair or 
just a custom assembly public key. If you provide the key pair, then all SSCLI 
assemblies will be signed with this full key pair. This can be convenient if you 
wish to attempt to load the assembly under the .NET Framework for debugging. For 
example, jsc.exe will be fully signed so it will load under the .NET Framework 
with no errors.</p>
<p>What will happen when you use the keyconfig tool is the new custom key values 
you provide will be used as a replacement for all keys for building assemblies. </p>
<p>Assemblies such as mscorlib.dll and System.dll will be built with the ECMA 
public key (see description above) but will be signed with the private key that 
you provided. This will continue to work because the SSCLI assembly verification 
code will now treat the new custom public key as a special case when loading 
these assemblies. </p>
<p>However, assemblies that do not normally have the ECMA public key (for 
example, Microsoft.JScript.dll) will now be built with a new public key and 
signed with a new private key. Any code that you develop that references these 
assemblies will not run under the .NET Framework because the public key stored 
in the assembly reference will not match any installed assemblies.</p>
<p>If you choose the <b>delaysign</b> option with the keyconfig tool, then all&nbsp; 
SSCLI assemblies will be built as delay-signed. The assemblies that would 
normally be signed with the ECMA public key will continue to be signed with that 
public key and other assemblies contain the new custom public key.</p>
<h2><a name="MinimumVisualStudio.NETRequirements"></a>Minimum Visual Studio .NET 
Requirements</h2>
<p>To build the SSCLI implementation on Microsoft&reg; Windows&reg; XP requires Visual 
Studio .NET, as stated in the <a href="../readfirst.html">readfirst.html</a>.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>The minimum installation of Visual Studio .NET required to support the SSCLI 
is to install Visual C++&reg; .NET.&nbsp; Within the options for installing Visual 
C++ .NET, the C runtime libraries must be selected because the runtime header 
files are required by the SSCLI build process.</p>
<h2><a name="PerlonWindowsXP"></a>Perl on Windows&reg; XP</h2>
<p>A Perl distribution must be installed on Windows XP in order to build the 
SSCLI source tree.&nbsp; You can go to <a href="http://www.activestate.com">
www.activestate.com</a> and install the free download of Perl (preferably 
version 5.6.1, builds 630 and later).&nbsp; </p>
<p>The Perl installation must correctly modify your environment variables so 
that Perl is in your path.&nbsp; The env.bat file will search your path and will 
set the PERLLIB environment variable assuming there is a LIB directory that is a 
peer of the location where perl.exe is installed. </p>
<p>You must install Perl with administrator-level privileges.&nbsp; If you 
install the ActiveState Perl distribution while you are logged in with only 
user-level privileges, the installer will not be able to modify your environment 
variables and the SSCLI build process will not work correctly.</p>
<h2><a name="RequiredSwapSizeUnderFreeBSD"></a>Required Swap Size Under FreeBSD</h2>
<p>The SSCLI requires 256MB of memory to build without slowing down 
considerably.&nbsp; Users building the SSCLI on FreeBSD on systems with 128MB of 
memory report that they must increase the available swap space to twice the 
default size (default is 2x memory) or at least 512MB.&nbsp; The build will 
proceed very slowly under this configuration but it will usually complete.</p>
<h2><a name="ChangestoMakefileRequirements"></a>Changes to Makefile Requirements</h2>
<p>The first source release of the SSCLI used makefiles that required the use of 
BSD make on FreeBSD 4.5.&nbsp; These makefiles were incompatible with other 
variants of the make utility.&nbsp; The makefiles in the current release have 
been modified to remove the dependency on BSD make.</p>
<h2><a name="LimitationsofSecurityZonesinSharedSourceCLI"></a>Limitations of 
Security Zones in SSCLI</h2>
<p>Due to portability modifications to the security implementation, support for 
mapping URLs to security zones is limited in the SSCLI security implementation. 
All file URLs will map to the zone of the local computer (LocalMachine) and all 
other URLs will map to the Internet zone. Ensure that you understand 
this limitation if you run code that relies on security zones generated from 
URLs.</p>
<h2><a name="ChangestoPer-UserConfigurationDirectoryLocation"></a>Changes to 
Per-User Configuration Directory Location</h2>
<p>In the first source release of the SSCLI, the directory where 
user-configuration information was stored was %userprofile%\rotor on Microsoft&reg; 
Windows&reg; or ~/.rotor on UNIX system-based platforms.&nbsp; This caused problems 
when trying to run checked, free, or fastchecked suites simultaneously because 
they all shared the same user configuration location.&nbsp; Modifications have 
been made to allow more complete side-by-side isolation of SSCLI builds.</p>
<p>The new user configuration directory name is created by generating a unique 
name based on a hash of the path to the platform adaptation layer (PAL) library 
(rotor_pal.dll on Windows, librotor_pal.so on FreeBSD, and librotor_pal.dylib on 
Mac&reg; OS X).&nbsp; The new user configuration directory location is: 
%userprofile%\rotor\&lt;hash&gt;\ on Windows or ~/.rotor&lt;hash&gt; on UNIX system-based 
platforms, where &lt;hash&gt; is a 40-character hash of the path to the PAL dynamic 
library.</p>
<p>For example, if your user name on Windows is jsmith then the per-user 
configuration settings directory would be something like:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>C:\Documents and 
  Settings\jsmith\rotor\clejgcjcdhmbcjpgllccjfagplehoohojacjmnho</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note: Named shared memory objects also use this naming convention which 
should prevent contention for named objects during execution of code in other 
running instances of the SSCLI.&nbsp; </p>
<p>To review the implementation of this naming convention, search for the 
MangleObjectNameW() function and the associated global<br>
variable <i>NameManglerW</i> in the source code in the PAL subdirectories.</p>
<h2><a name="RuntimeVersionValue"></a>Runtime Version Value</h2>
<p>All assemblies created by using either the SSCLI or .NET Framework compilers 
contain a entry in the metadata root (see ECMA-335 specification, Partition II, 
section 23.2.1) that specifies which version of the .NET Framework should be 
loaded to run the assembly.&nbsp;This is a different version value than the assembly 
version and is utilized by the .NET Framework on Windows but it ignored by the 
SSCLI. The .NET Framework relies on the Windows loader to first load an 
executable assembly and because there can be multiple, side-by-side versions of 
the .NET Framework installed, the runtime version value is needed to indicate 
which version of the .NET Framework should be given the assembly to load and 
execute.&nbsp; Although the runtime version value is included in all assemblies, 
it is only normally relevant to executable assemblies.</p>
<p>The SSCLI does not utilize platform loaders to run assemblies, instead it 
relies on the clix launcher application. The clix launcher loads SSCLI core 
files based on the directory from which it was loaded so the SSCLI has no need 
to use the runtime version value and the value is ignored.</p>
<p>When an assembly is built using the .NET Framework compilers, the default 
behavior is to store the current version of the .NET Framework as the runtime 
version value.&nbsp; For example, with version 1.0 of the .NET Framework the 
runtime version value would be &quot;v1.0.3705&quot;.&nbsp; This allows the .NET Framework 
pre-loader to find and load the version v1.0.3705 core implementation files.</p>
<p>If you intend to develop assemblies using the SSCLI and run them on the .NET 
Frameworks you might need to modify the runtime version value in order for them 
to load.&nbsp; By default the compilers in the SSCLI will generate assemblies 
with the value of &quot;v1.0.0&quot;.&nbsp; This value does allow executable assemblies to 
load in version 1.0 of the .NET Framework and was chosen because it represents a 
generic version number that still works with version 1.0. However, future 
versions of the .NET Framework might not recognize this version value. Instead 
the value that should be used by an assembly that does not have a strict version 
requirement is the string: &quot;Standard CLI 2002&quot;.&nbsp; This value, however, will 
not work with version 1.0 of the .NET Framework.</p>
<p>To summarize, the following are a set of runtime version values and the 
version of the .NET Framework on Windows into which the executable assembly 
containing the value will be loaded:</p>
<table border="1" width="90%">
  <tr>
    <th width="23%">Version value</th>
    <th width="77%">Loaded version of .NET Framework</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="23%">1.0.0</td>
    <td width="77%">Version 1.0 of the .NET Framework.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="23%">v1.0.3705</td>
    <td width="77%">Version 1.0 of the .NET Framework.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="23%">v1.n.nnnn</td>
    <td width="77%">Version 1.n.nnnn of the .NET Framework, where n is any 
    digit.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="23%">Standard CLI 2002</td>
    <td width="77%">Future ECMA version 1.0 compliant versions of the .NET 
    Framework.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>To change the runtime version value that will be built into assemblies 
created by SSCLI compilers, open the
<a href="../clr/src/DLLS/mscoree/mscoree.cpp">
sscli\clr\src\dlls\mscoree\mscoree.cpp</a> file.&nbsp; Search for the string:&nbsp; 
ROTOR_VERSION_NUMBER.&nbsp; You will see the following code:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>#ifndef ROTOR_VERSION_NUMBER
// By using (L&quot;v1.0.0&quot;), this should allow the us to run on the desktop version as well
#define ROTOR_VERSION_NUMBER (L&quot;v1.0.0&quot;)
#endif</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Changing the value of the #define ROTOR_VERSION_NUMBER will change the 
runtime version value in assemblies that are subsequently built with SSCLI 
compilers. You will need to rebuild the SSCLI after changing this value in order 
to have the change applied.</p>
<p>See the <a href="../samples/utilities/getcliversion/getcliversion.html">
GetCliVersion sample</a> for more information on how to inspect and modify the 
runtime version value in an existing assembly.</p>
<h2><a name="PlatformRequirementsforPOSIXThreadsSupport"></a>Platform 
Requirements for POSIX Threads Support</h2>
<p>The SSCLI requires specific functionality in the POSIX threads (Pthreads) 
implementation on any platform to which it might be ported.&nbsp; Specifically, 
exception handling in the SSCLI is dependent on several extra parameters sent to 
SA_SIGINFO signal handlers which provide details about the signal and the 
context in which it occurred. </p>
<p>An example of a UNIX system-based platform which does not currently provide 
this required functionality is OpenBSD 3.1.&nbsp; It would be very difficult to 
port the SSCLI to such a platform and maintain exception handling functionality.&nbsp; 
Future versions of OpenBSD might provide this functionality and would then 
be available as a porting target for the SSCLI.</p>
<h2><a name="KnownIssues"></a>Known Issues</h2>
<h3><a name="ProblemswithtarUtilityExpandingSSCLIArchiveonMacOSX"></a>Problems 
with tar Utility Expanding SSCLI Archive on Mac OS X</h3>
<p>Due to problems with the default implementation of the tar archive utility on 
Mac OS X, the gnutar archive utility should instead be used to extract the SSCLI 
distribution archive.&nbsp; You can also use version 7.0 of the Stuffit&#8482; 
Expander  
application to expand the SSCLI archive on Mac OS X.&nbsp; You must use version 
7.0 or newer because older versions do not have full long file name support and 
some files in the archive have names with more than thirty-one characters.</p>
<p>Finding a file named @LongLink in the directory where you expanded the SSCLI 
archive is one indication that you used the tar utility and file name truncation 
occurred. The extracted distribution might not build or run correctly due to 
file name truncation.&nbsp; The exact behavior varies depending on the length of 
the path into which the archive was extracted.</p>
<p>There are no known issues using the default tar utility to extract the 
archive on other UNIX system-based platforms.</p>
<h3><a name="CorDBGDebuggerandMulti-processorKernelsonFreeBSD"></a>CorDBG 
Debugger and Multi-processor Kernels on FreeBSD 4.5</h3>
<p>The Managed Code Debugger (cordbg) might not work correctly on FreeBSD 
installations that use a multi-processor kernel. This problem has been 
reproduced using FreeBSD 4.5. </p>
<p>This problem is fixed on FreeBSD 4.7.</p>
<p>There are no known problems building or running the SSCLI and CorDBG on 
Windows or Mac OS X multi-processor systems.</p>
<h3><a name="JITCompilationandCodePitching"></a>JIT Compilation and Code 
Pitching</h3>
<p>Several known problems  might occur when the just-in-time (JIT) 
compiler implementation pitches code as it attempts to minimize the code heap 
size.</p>
<h4>Incorrect Stack Trace in Managed Code</h4>
<p>In some cases, when an exception is thrown the code for methods on the stack 
has been pitched.&nbsp; This  causes the original starting address in 
StartOfTheMethod to be lost. For safety in this release of the SSCLI 
implementation, the offset is set to 0 to avoid pointing into unallocated 
memory.&nbsp; This means that the stack trace will always show the first line of 
the function for functions that have been pitched.</p>
<h4>Running Out of Code Heap Space</h4>
<p>When the SSCLI runs out of code heap space, several different errors can 
occur:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fatal stack overflow.</li>
  <li>Unhandled out-of-memory exception.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Code Pitching Options</h4>
<p>There are a variety of options that modify the behavior of code pitching 
which 
can be set using environment variables. Two useful options are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>COMPlusCodePitchEnable<ul>
    <li>This option will affect all builds and can be used to turn off code 
    pitching. The default for code pitching is that it is turned on so by 
    clearing the environment variable you can restore the code pitching 
    functionality.</li>
    <li>Example:<blockquote>
      <pre>set COMPlusCodePitchEnable=false</pre>
    </blockquote>
    </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>COMPlusMaxCodeCacheSize<ul>
    <li>This option only affects the fastchecked or checked builds. It allows 
    you to set the size of the code cache.<blockquote>
      <pre>set ComPlusMaxCodeCacheSize=10000</pre>
    </blockquote>
    </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>See the information in <a href="../clr/src/vm/eeconfig.cpp">eeconfig.cpp</a> 
for more information about further code pitching options and other 
implementation details. See <a href="techinfo/logging.html">logging.html</a> for 
general information about the SSCLI logging infrastructure.</p>
<h3><a name="InstallPathCannotContainSpaces"></a>Install Path Cannot Contain 
Spaces</h3>
<p>The SSCLI implementation cannot be installed to a location with spaces in the 
path name.&nbsp; Please extract the .tgz file into a directory location with no 
spaces in the name.</p>
<h3><a name="WinzipandCR/LF"></a>WinZip&reg; and CR/LF</h3>
<p>If you use the WinZip utility (<a href="http://www.winzip.com">http://www.winzip.com</a>) 
to extract the SSCLI archive on Windows you must turn off the smart CR/LF 
conversion option. Some files in the SSCLI archive might not extract correctly if 
this option is turned on. To turn off the option in WinZip go to the <b>Options</b> 
item on the <b>Configuration</b> menu. On the <b>Miscellaneous</b> tab make sure the item 
labeled &quot;TAR file smart CR/LF conversion&quot; is not selected.</p>
<h3><a name="Pathand.NETFramework"></a>Path and the .NET Framework</h3>
<p>When you run one of the SSCLI implementations of a tool or utility on 
Windows you must make sure that the SSCLI build output directory is in your path 
before the .NET Framework or Visual Studio bin directories or errors will occur. For example, if you change into the .NET Framework directory which contains 
files like mscorwks.dll and mscorlib.dll, and then attempt to run the SSCLI 
version of metainfo.exe you will see an error like the following: </p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>metainfo.exe - Entry Point Not Found
The procedure entry point SetFusionShutdownCallback could not be located in the dynamic link library fusion.dll.

</pre>
</blockquote>
<h3><a name="FreeBSDKernelOptionsMightCauseProblemsWithBuild"></a>FreeBSD Kernel 
Options Might Cause Problems with Build</h3>
<p>It has been reported that compiling the FreeBSD kernel with some modified 
configuration options might cause the SSCLI build process to fail.&nbsp; The 
symptom of the problem in the reported case was that the C# compiler would core 
dump when building the FX tree.&nbsp;Here is a snippet from the builddf.log 
file:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>/out:/usr/local/src/sscli/build/v1.x86fstchk.rotor/private/lib/System.dll 
@objdf/rotor_x86/csc.rsp.lib
Fatal error 'Can't create gc thread' at line ? in file
/usr/src/lib/libc_r/uthread/uthread_create.c
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The problem was solved by removing the following settings from the kernel 
configuration file and then recompiling the kernel:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre># To use more memory per process
options MAXDSIZ=&quot;(2048*1024*1024)&quot;
options MAXSSIZ=&quot;(256*1024*1024)&quot;
options DFLDSIZ=&quot;(1024*1024*1024)&quot;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<h3><a name="TclandTkMustBeInstalledToRunPIGUISamples"></a>Tcl and Tk Must Be 
Installed to Run PIGUI Samples</h3>
<p>All the samples under the sscli\samples\pigui directory require Tcl and Tk to 
be installed on the system&nbsp;in order to execute. On Windows, one option is 
to install the ActiveTcl 8.4.0 distribution from
<a href="http://www.ActiveState.com">www.ActiveState.com</a>.&nbsp; Versions of 
Tcl and Tk older than 8.4.0 might not work correctly with the SSCLI Tk sample 
applications. On FreeBSD 4.5 and Mac OS X, the Tcl and Tk 8.4.0 packages will have to 
be downloaded and installed.</p>

<p>Platform-independent UI (PIGUI) samples built under one platform will not run 
on other platforms. For example, PIGUI samples built on Windows will not run on 
FreeBSD or Mac OS X. Also, these samples built on Mac OS X will not run on 
Windows or FreeBSD.</p>
<p>The samples rely on platform invoke wrappers in
<a href="../samples/pigui/tk/tclnative.cs">sscli\samples\pigui\tk\tknative.cs</a> 
which use a constant value that contains either  tk84.dll on Windows, libtk84.so on FreeBSD, 
and libtk84.dylib on Mac OS X under an #ifdef switch. Built sample applications will have the name of the Tk support DLL built into 
them but the file name changes across platforms.</p>

Problems Using SOS from gdb Debugger on UNIX System-based Platforms</h3>
<p>The version of the gdb debugger that installs by default on FreeBSD 4.5 has 
problems using the SOS debugger extension.&nbsp; You can obtain more information 
on using gdb and SOS in <a href="debugging/sos.html">sos.html</a><i>. </i></p>
<p>Problem reports indicate that the version of gdb that ships with FreeBSD 4.5 
might crash and core dump when used with the SOS debugger extension library. However, later versions of gdb do not seem to have this problem.</p>
<h4>SOS Implementation Details</h4>
<p>SOS is implemented as a dynamically loaded library, sos.dll on Windows,  libsos.so on FreeBSD, 
and libsos.dylib on Mac OS X. It can be loaded from the Windows SDK platform 
debuggers NTSD or WinDBG on Windows, or from gdb on UNIX system-based platforms. 
However the manner in which it is loaded differs between the Windows debuggers 
and gdb.</p>
<p>On Windows under NTSD or WinDBG, the SOS dll is loaded into the debugger 
process and it communicates across-process to obtain data from the process being 
debugged. Under gdb, extension libraries are loaded into the process being 
debugged and function calls into SOS are made to the external process from the 
debugger. The SSCLI supports this loading procedure by means of a 
function in the core runtime library libsscoree.so (libsscoree.dylib on Mac OS 
X), which uses the PAL and the 
LoadLibrary() API to load the SOS library into the CLI process being debugged.

<h3><a name="VisualStudio.NETBeta2DoesNotWorkasSharedSourceCLIBuildEnvironment">
</a>Visual Studio .NET Beta2 Does Not Work as SSCLI Build Environment</h3>
<p>The SSCLI implementation requires the released version of the Visual Studio 
.NET development system as the build environment.&nbsp; The build process does 
not work with the Visual Studio .NET version 7.0 beta2 release.</p>
<p>Symptoms of the problem are log file errors like the following:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>Studio.NET\Vc7\PlatformSDK\Include\WinNT.h(4323) : error C2220: warning treated as error - 
        no object file generated C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual
Studio.NET\Vc7\PlatformSDK\Include\WinNT.h(4323) : warning C4005: 'THREAD_BASE_PRIORITY_MIN' : macro redefinition
        ..\rotor_pal.h(1776) : see previous definition of 'THREAD_BASE_PRIORITY_MIN' C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual
Studio.NET\Vc7\PlatformSDK\Include\WinNT.h(4324) : warning C4005: 'THREAD_BASE_PRIORITY_IDLE' : macro redefinition
        ..\rotor_pal.h(1777) : see previous definition of 'THREAD_BASE_PRIORITY_IDLE' C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual
Studio.NET\Vc7\PlatformSDK\Include\WinBase.h(3797) : warning C4005: 'TLS_OUT_OF_INDEXES' : macro redefinition
        ..\rotor_pal.h(1802) : see previous definition of 'TLS_OUT_OF_INDEXES' 
        NMAKE : fatal error U1077: 'cl' : return code '0x2' Stop.
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>These particular errors are caused by changes to the macro definitions 
between the beta and release versions of Visual Studio .NET.&nbsp; Since the 
SSCLI was developed using the released version, these macro definitions do not 
match.</p>
<h3><a name="OperationNotPermittedError"></a>Operation Not Permitted Error from 
./configure on FreeBSD</h3>
<p>If your user account on FreeBSD is not a member of group wheel, you may see a 
sequence of errors during an SSCLI build that look like:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>config.status: creating makefile
mv: makefile: set owner/group (was: 1000/0): Operation not permitted
config.status: creating makefile.common
mv: makefile.common: set owner/group (was: 1000/0): Operation not permitted</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>These errors specifically occur if you run ./configure in the SSCLI 
directory.</p>
<p>These errors are not significant and do not indicate a build problem. The 
errors are due to the way the <b>mv</b> command works with permissions on 
FreeBSD.&nbsp; The <b>mv</b> command is attempting to preserve user and group 
information when it moves the file but because the file has a group of wheel but 
the user does not, the <b>mv</b> command cannot preserve this information. The 
file is successfully copied and  simply ends up as a member of the user's group 
so the error messages can be ignored.</p>
