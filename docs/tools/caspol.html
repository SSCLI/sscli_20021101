<H1>Code Access Security Policy Tool (caspol.exe)</H1>

<P>The Code Access Security Policy tool enables users and administrators to modify security policy for the machine policy level, the user policy level, and the enterprise policy level. </P>

<P>The caspol.exe tool is a managed application.&nbsp; To execute managed 
applications you must use the <a href="clix.html">clix</a> application launcher.</P>

<h4>Usage</h4>

<p>The following options can be specified using either a dash (-) or a slash (/).</p>

<P>or</P>

<P><B>-af</B> <I>assembly_file</I></P>
</TD>
<TD width=50%>Adds an assembly that implements a custom security object (such as a custom permission or a custom membership condition) to the full trust assembly list for a specific policy level. The <I>assembly_file</I> argument specifies the assembly to add. This file must be signed with a strong name. You can sign an assembly with a strong name using the <A HREF="sn.html">Strong Name Tool (Sn.exe)</A>.
<P>When a permission set containing a custom permission is added to policy, the assembly implementing the custom permission must be added to the full trust list for that policy level. In general,  assemblies implementing custom security objects (such as custom code groups or membership conditions) used in a security policy (such as the machine policy) should be added to the full trust assembly list. If the assembly implementing the custom security object references other assemblies, those assemblies must also be added to the list, and so on. </P>

</TD>
<TD width=50%>Adds a new code group to the code group hierarchy. You can specify either the <I>parent_label</I> or <I>parent_name</I>. The <I>parent_label</I> argument specifies the label (such as 1. or 1.1.) of the code group that is the parent of the code group being added. The <I>parent_name </I>argument specifies the name of the code group that is the parent of the code group being added. Because <I>parent_label</I> and <I>parent_name</I> can be used interchangeably, 
caspol.exe must be able to distinguish between them. Therefore, <I>parent_name</I> cannot begin with a number. Additionally, <I>parent_name</I> can only contain A-Z, 0-9 and the underscore character.   
<P>The <I>mship </I>argument specifies the membership condition for the new code group. For more information, see the table of <A HREF="#cpgrfcodeaccesssecuritypolicyutilitycaspolexeanchor2">mship arguments</A> later in this section. </P>

<P>The <I>pset_name</I> argument is the name of the permission set that will be associated with the new code group. You can also set one or more <I>flags</I> for the new group.

<h2>Remarks</h2>

<P>Security policy is expressed using three policy levels: machine policy, user policy, and enterprise policy. The set of permissions that an assembly receives is determined by the intersection of the permission sets allowed by these three policy levels. Each policy level is represented by a hierarchical structure of code groups. Every code group has a membership condition that determines which code is a member of that group. A named permission set is also associated with each code group. This permission set specifies the permissions the 
CLI allows code to have if the code meets the membership condition. A code group hierarchy, 
together with its associated named permission sets, defines and maintains each level of security policy. You can use the<B>-user</B>, <B>-customuser</B>, <B>-machine</B> and <B>-enterprise </B>options to set the level of security policy.</P>

<h3>Referencing Code Groups and Permission Sets</h3>

<P>To facilitate references to code groups in a hierarchy, the <B>-list</B> option displays an indented list of code groups along with their numerical labels (1, 1.1, 1.1.1, and so on). The other command-line operations that target code groups also use the numerical labels to refer to specific code groups.</P>

<P>Named permission sets are referenced by their names. The <B>-list</B> 
option displays the list of code groups followed by a list of named permission 
sets available in that policy. </P>

<h3>Code Access Security Policy Tool Behavior</h3>

<P>All options use the runtime version that caspol.exe was installed with. If you run the 
Code Access Security Policy tool that was installed with version <I>X</I> of the runtime, the changes apply only to that version of the runtime. Other side-by-side installations of the runtime, if any, are not affected. If you run 
caspol.exe from the command line without being in a versioned runtime directory, the tool is executed from the first runtime directory in the path (usually the most recent runtime version installed).</P>

<P>When a user without administrative rights runs caspol.exe, all options refer to the user level policy unless the <B>-machine</B> option is specified. When an administrator runs 
caspol.exe, all options refer to the machine policy unless the <B>-user</B> option is specified.</P>

<P>The Code Access Security Policy tool must be granted the equivalent of the <B>Everything</B> permission set to function. The tool has a protective mechanism that prevents policy from being modified in ways that would prevent 
caspol.exe from being granted the permissions it needs to run. If you try to make such changes, 
caspol.exe notifies you that the requested policy change will break the tool, and the policy change is rejected. You can turn this protective mechanism off for a given command by using the <B>-force</B> option.</P>

<h3><B><A NAME="cpgrfcodeaccesssecuritypolicyutilitycaspolexeanchor1"></A></B>Manually Editing the Security Configuration Files</h3>

<P>Three security configuration files correspond to the three policy levels supported by 
Code Access Security Policy tool: one for the machine policy, one for a given user's policy, and one for the enterprise policy. These files are created on disk only when machine, user, or enterprise policy is changed using 
caspol.exe. You can use the <B>-reset</B> option in caspol.exe to save the default security policy to disk, if needed.</P>

<P>In most cases, it is recommended that you do not manually edit the security configuration files. 
However, might be necessary to modify these files, such as when an administrator wants to edit the security configuration for a particular user. </P>

<H4>Examples</H4>

<P><B>-addfulltrust</B></P>

<P>Assume that a permission set containing a custom permission has been added to machine policy. This custom permission is implemented in <CODE>MyPerm.exe</CODE>, and <CODE>MyPerm.exe</CODE> references classes in <CODE>MyOther.exe</CODE>. Both assemblies must be added to the full trust assembly list. The following command adds the <CODE>MyPerm.exe</CODE> assembly to the full trust list for the machine policy.</P>

<PRE>caspol -machine -addfulltrust MyPerm.exe</PRE>

<P>The following command adds the <CODE>MyOther.exe</CODE> assembly to the full trust list for the machine policy.</P>

<PRE>caspol -machine -addfulltrust MyOther.exe</PRE>

<P><B>-addgroup</B></P>

<P>The following command adds a child code group to the root of the machine policy code group hierarchy. The new code group is a member of the <B>Internet</B> zone and is associated with the <B>Execution</B> permission set.</P>

<PRE>caspol -machine -addgroup 1.  -zone Internet Execution</PRE>

<P><B>-addpset</B></P>

<P>The following command adds the <CODE>Mypset</CODE> permission set to the user policy.</P>

<PRE>caspol -user -addpset Mypset.xml Mypset</PRE>

<P><B>-chggroup</B></P>

<P>The following command changes the permission set in the user policy of the code group  labeled 1.2. to the <B>Execution</B> permission set.</P>

<PRE>caspol -user -chggroup 1.2. Execution</PRE>

<P>The following command changes the membership condition in the default policy of the code group labeled 1.2.1. and changes the setting of the <B>exclusive</B> flag. The membership condition is defined to be code that originates from the <B>Internet</B> zone and the <B>exclusive</B> flag is switched on.</P>
