<H1>Resource File Generator (resgen.exe)</H1>

<P>The Resource File Generator converts .txt files and .resx (XML-based resource 
format) files to common language infrastructure (CLI) binary .resources files 
that can be embedded in a runtime binary executable or compiled into satellite 
assemblies. The Resource File Generator performs the following conversions:

<UL>
	<LI>Converts .txt files to .resources or .resx files.</li>

	<LI>Converts .resources files to text or .resx files.</li>

	<LI>Converts .resx files to text or .resources files.</li>
</UL>

<p>The Resource File Generator is a managed application.&nbsp; In order to execute managed 
applications in the Shared Source CLI (SSCLI), you must use the <a href="clix.html">clix</a> application launcher.</p>

<P>This argument is optional when converting from a .txt or .resx file. You can specify the .resources extension when converting a text or .resx file to a .resources file.  If you do not specify an o<I>utputFilename</I>, 
the Resource File Generator appends a .resources extension to the input <I>filename </I>argument and writes the file to the directory that contains <I>filename</I>. </P>

<P>The <I>outputFilename</I> argument is mandatory when converting from a .resources file. Specify the .resx extension when converting a .resources file to an XML-based resource file. Specify the .txt extension when converting a .resources file to a text file. You should only convert a .resources file to a .txt file when the .resources file contains only string values.</P>

<H4>Remarks</H4>

<P>The Resource File Generator converts files by wrapping the methods implemented by the following four classes: 

<UL>
	<LI>The <b>ResourceReader</b> class reads a .resources file.</li>

	<LI>The <b>ResourceWriter</b> class creates a .resources file from specified resources.</li>

	<LI>The <b>ResXResourceReader</b> class reads a .resx file. </li>

	<LI>The <b>ResXResourceWriter</b> class creates a .resx file from specified resources.</li>
</UL>

<P>Note that a .resx file created by the <B>ResXResourceWriter</B> cannot be 
used directly by a .NET Framework application. Before adding this file to your 
application, run it through the Resource File Generator to convert it to a .resources file. 
For more information about implementing these classes in your code, see their respective reference topics.</P>

<P>In order for the Resource File Generator to be able to parse your input, it is critical that your .txt and .resx files follow the correct format.</P>

<P>Text files can only contain string resources. String resources are useful if 
you are writing an application that must have strings translated into several 
languages. For example, you can easily regionalize menu strings by using the 
appropriate string resource. The Resource File Generator reads text files containing name/value pairs, where the name is a string that describes the resource, and the value is the resource string itself.  You must specify each name/value pair on a separate line as follows:</P>

<blockquote>

<PRE>name=value</PRE>

</blockquote>

<P>The Resource File Generator checks the text file for duplicate resource 
names. For more details on the text file format, see the
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpguide/html/cpconresourcesintextfileformat.asp">
Resources in Text File Format</a> topic on MSDN.</P>

<P>The .resx resource file format consists of XML entries. Similar to .txt files, you can specify string resources within these XML entries. A primary advantage of .resx files over .txt files is that you can also specify or embed objects. When you view a .resx file, you can actually see the binary form of an embedded object (a picture for example) when this binary information is a part of the resource manifest. Just as with .txt files, you can open a .resx file with a text editor  and write, parse, and manipulate the contents.&nbsp; 
Note that in order to do this, you need to have a good knowledge of XML tags and 
the .resx file structure.</P>

<P>In order to create a .resources file containing embedded nonstring objects, 
you must either use the Resource File Generator to convert a .resx file containing objects or add the 
object resources to your file directly from code, using the methods provided by 
the <b>ResourceWriter</b> class. If you use the Resource File Generator to convert a .resources file 
containing objects to a .txt file, all the string resources will be converted 
correctly, but the data types of the nonstring objects will also be written to 
the file as strings. You will lose the embedded objects in the conversion and 
the Resource File Generator will report that an error occurred in retrieving the resources.</P>

<P>When you have finished creating .resources files with the Resource File 
Generator, use the
<a href="al.html">Assembly Linker (Al.exe)</a> to either embed the resources in a runtime binary executable or compile them into satellite assemblies.</P>

<H4>Examples</H4>

<P>The following command, with no options specified, displays the command syntax 
and options for the Resource File Generator.</P>

<PRE>resgen</PRE>

<P>The following command reads the name/value pairs in <CODE>myResources.txt</CODE> and writes a binary resources file named <CODE>myResources.resources. </CODE>Because the output file name is not specified explicitly, it receives the same name as the input file by default.</P>

<PRE>resgen myResources.txt </PRE>

<P>The following command reads the name/value pairs in <CODE>myResources.txt</CODE> and writes a binary resources file named <CODE>yourResources.resources</CODE>.</P>

<PRE>resgen myResources.txt yourResources.resources</PRE>

<P>The following command reads an XML-based input file <CODE>myResources.resx</CODE> and writes a binary resources file named <CODE>myResources.resources</CODE>.</P>

<PRE>resgen myResources.resx myResources.resources</PRE>

<P>The following command reads a binary resources file <CODE>myResources.resources</CODE> and writes an XML-based output file named <CODE>myResources.resx</CODE>.</P>

<PRE>resgen myResources.resources myResources.resx</PRE>

<P>The following command reads an XML-based input file <CODE>myResources.resx</CODE> and writes a .txt file named <CODE>myResources.txt. </CODE>Note that if the .resx file contains any embedded objects, they will not be accurately converted into the .txt file.</P>

<PRE>resgen myResources.resx myResources.txt
</PRE>
