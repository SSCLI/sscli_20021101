<h2><a name="Overview"></a>Overview</h2>
<p>
The tests in the Shared Source CLI (SSCLI) are broken into two large sections, with each 
section
broken into several smaller subsections.  The large sections are:
<ul>
  <li><a href="#PALTestSuite">PAL Test Suite</a> - This test suite and test driver 
      were developed to act as a quality suite for the 
      Platform Adaptation Layer (PAL) which is used to implement the SSCLI on 
  multiple platforms.</li> 
  <li><a href="#SSCLIQualitySuites">SSCLI Quality Suites</a> - These suites and 
  the associated driver  test everything else in the system. </li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="PALTestSuite"></a>PAL Test Suite</h2>
<p>The Platform Adaptation Layer (PAL) Test Suite is designed to validate the
quality of the PAL.  You can run this suites of tests before anything else in the SSCLI is running; therefore, it has no
dependencies on anything running other than the PAL itself.</p>

<p>The driver script for the PAL Test Suite is called <a
href="../tests/pvtrun.pl">pvtrun.pl</a>. After you build the PAL,
you can execute the tests by running this script; it will execute around 1200 
tests from the <a
href="../tests/palsuite">palsuite</a> directory.
</p>

<p>The PAL test harness is located in the <a href="../tests/harness">test_harness directory</a>.  The
test harness uses several environment variables that
indicate where to find its test list, where to store results
and where to find its helper driver <a
href="../tests/harness/xrun">xrun</a>. These environment variables are 
usually set in
a wrapper script, such as <a href="../tests/pvtrun.pl">pvtrun.pl</a>,
but they can also be set individually in the environment for manual execution.</p>

<p>Additional tests  are not run by default from the driver 
script. See the PAL test <a
href="../tests/palsuite/readme.txt">readme.txt</a> for more details on running the remaining 
suites.</p>

<h2><a name="SSCLIQualitySuites"></a>SSCLI Quality Suites</h2>

<p> The SSCLI Quality Suites  are the tests for everything other
than the PAL.  The test inventory is not a complete breadth test bed but is 
focused on  key areas of functionality. </p>

<h3><a name="QualitySuitesTestDriver"></a>Quality Suites Test Driver</h3>

<p>The main test driver is implemented in <code><a href="../tests/rrun.pl">
rrun.pl</a></code>. The rrun driver assumes that tests are distributed in a directory tree,
with their configuration information located in the directory with the
tests.  Tests are required to be self-verifying (no baselines are
used).&nbsp; The rrun driver traverses the directory tree starting with the working
directory of the process that invoked the driver and working down the 
directory structure collecting
the test information.  All tests that match a simple set of
criteria are executed and the results reported.</p>

<p>The source comments at the top of the <code><a href="../tests/rrun.pl">
rrun.pl</a> </code>file should be consulted for more
complete details of driver operation.</p>

<p>Running the rrun driver from the <a href="../tests">tests</a> directory  causes the entire test
inventory to be run using the default criteria.  To run a subset
of tests simply change the working directory to
the one listed, and then run the rrun driver.</p>

<h3><a name="QualitySuitesandBVTs"></a>Quality Suite Tests</h3>

<h4>Base Verification Tests</h4>

<p>The Base Verification Tests (BVTs) are a set of quick tests that can be run after 
a source modification is made to ensure that basic functionality continues to work 
correctly.&nbsp; These are 
sometimes called &quot;smoke tests.&quot; These tests are
located in <a href="../tests/bvt">tests/bvt</a>.</p>

<h4>CIL Tests</h4>

<p>The base common intermediate language (CIL) tests are located in <a
href="../tests/il_bvt">tests/il_bvt</a>. These tests provide core
coverage of the CIL instructions in the system.</p>

<h4>Verifier Tests</h4>

<p>Verifier tests  check the verifier in the JIT-compiler.
These tests are located in <a
href="../tests/security/verifier">tests/security/verifier</a>.  In
addition to these tests,  many tests throughout the tree require verification to 
be either off or on;&nbsp; these are marked with the attributes <code>&lt;VERIFIERMUSTBEOFF&gt;</code> and
<code>&lt;VERIFIERMUSTBEOON&gt;</code> in the appropriate
<code>rsources</code> file.</p>

<h4>Base Class Library Tests</h4>

<p>You can find tests for the base class libraries  in <a
href="../tests/bcl">tests/bcl</a>.</p>

<h4>Miscellaneous Tests and Support Infrastructure</h4>

<p>The <a href="../tests/utilities">tests/utilities</a> directory
contains support functions for other tests.    </p>

<p>The <a
href="../tests/dev">tests/dev</a> directory contains test that cover specific 
cases not covered by other tests but discovered during the development process.</p>

<h3><a name="BuildandLogging"></a>Build and Logging</h3>

<p>The test driver rrun respects build type.&nbsp; 
  Executables are built into the obj, objd, objdf subdirectory depending on 
build type (see <a href="buildtools/building_sscli.html">
buildtools\building_sscli.html</a>).</p>

<p>Build log files are named rrun.log and rrun.err on the free build, rrundf.log and 
rrundf.err on the fastchecked build, and rrund.log and rrund.err on the checked 
build.</p>

<h3><a name="TestStrategy"></a>Test Strategy</h3>

<p>The following are some quick guidelines to help you plan your test usage:</p>

<ul>
  <li>To quickly verify that a build or change is working and didn't
      break anything obvious, run the tests in the <a
      href="../tests/bvt">tests/bvt</a> directory.  </li>
  <li>To check extensive changes or to verify that you have built without 
  problems, use full test run from the <a
      href="../tests">tests</a> directory.</li>
  <li>To run all the tests in the inventory, use the -l option when 
  running the rrun driver. Note that this can
      take a long time to complete.</li>
</ul>
