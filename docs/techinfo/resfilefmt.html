   <li>Section 2 - RuntimeResourceReader header.</li>
   <li>Section 3 - RuntimeResourceReader Name section.</li>
   <li>Section 4 - RuntimeResourceReader Data section.</li>

 <p>The first section is the Resource Manager header, which consists of a
 magic number that identifies this as a Resource file, and a <b>ResourceSet</b>
 class name.
  
 <p>The second section in the system default file format is the 
 RuntimeResourceSet specific header.  This contains a version number for
 the .resources file, the number of resources in this file, and the number of 
 different types contained in the file, followed by a list of fully 
 qualified type names.  This is followed by an array of hash values for
 each resource name, then an array of virtual offsets into the name section
 of the file.  The hashes allow you to do a binary search on an array of 
 integers to find a resource name very quickly without doing many string 
 compares (until you have found the target type).  If a hash
 matches, the index into the array of hash values is used as the index
 into the name position array to find the name of the resource.  The hash
 function used to compute these values is as follows:
 <pre>    uint hash = 5381;
    for(int i=0; i &lt; key.Length; i++)
        hash = ((hash &lt;&lt; 5) + hash) ^ key[i];
    return (int) hash;
 </pre>
 You must use exactly this hash function for reading and writing .resources
 files, because the values are saved to files on the disk.  Do not use the 
 <b>String.GetHashCode</b> method because its implementation might change in the
 future as developers find better and faster hash functions. The type table
 allows you to read multiple different classes from the same
 file,  including user-defined types, in a more efficient way than using 
   serialization, at least when your .resources file contains a reasonable 
 proportion of base data types such as strings or integers.  All non-intrinsic types are saved using serialization.
 
 <p>The third section of the file is the name section.  It contains a 
 series of resource names, written out as byte-length prefixed little-endian Unicode strings (UTF-16).  After each name is a four-byte virtual
 offset into the data section of the file, pointing to the relevant 
 string or serialized BLOB for this resource name.
     
 <p>The fourth section in the file is the data section, which consists
 of a type and a BLOB of bytes for each item in the file.  The type is 
 an integer index into the type table.  The data is specific to that type,
 but can be a number written in binary format, a String, or a serialized 
 Object.
 
 <p>This implementation, when used with the default <b>ResourceReader</b> class, 
 loads only the strings that you look up. The implementation can do string comparisons without 
 having to create a new <b>String</b> instance due to some memory-mapped file 
 optimizations in the <b>ResourceReader</b> and <b>FastResourceComparer</b> classes. 
 Therefore the memory that is touched when loading 
 resources is kept to a minimum.

 <p>In addition, the resource implementation supports object serialization in a 
 similar fashion. The ResourceManager builds an array of class types contained 
 in this file and writes it to the RuntimeResourceReader header section of the 
 file. Every resource will contain its type (as an index into the array of 
 classes) with the data for that resource. The Resource Manager will use the CLI serialization support.
 
 <p>All strings in the file format are written with <b>BinaryReader</b> and
 <b>BinaryWriter</b>, which write out the length of the string as a 7-bit-encoded
 integer, and then the contents as Unicode characters encoded in UTF-8.&nbsp; The
 
 7-bit encoding works as follows: If the value will fit completely in 
 seven bits, then a single byte is written; otherwise the high bit on the 
 first byte is set and a second byte is created by shifting the value 
 by 7 bits.  This is repeated until there are enough bytes to hold 
 the value.&nbsp; In the name table, each resource name is written in UTF-16 so 
 it is possible to do a byte-by-byte comparison against the contents of the file
 without allocating objects.

 <p>Support for serialization is required for objects that will be embedded in 
 resource files. CLI implementers should ensure that their
 <b>BinaryReader</b>, <b>BinaryWriter</b>, and <b>BinaryFormatter</b> classes are working correctly.
 
 <p>The offsets of each resource string are relative to the beginning of the 
 Data section of the file. This way, if a tool decides to add 
 one resource to a file, it    needs to increment only the number of 
 resources, add the hash and location of the last byte in the name section
 to the array of resource hashes and resource name positions (carefully
 keeping these arrays sorted), add the name to the end of the name and 
 offset list, possibly add the  list of types  (and increase 
 the number of items in the type table), and add the resource value at 
 the end of the file.  The other offsets would not need to be updated to 
 reflect the longer header section.
 
 <p>Resource files are currently limited to 2 gigabytes because of these 
 design parameters.
