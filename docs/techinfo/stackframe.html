<h1>Stack Frame Format  in the Shared Source CLI</h1>

<p>When executing just-in-time (JIT) compiled code in the Shared Source Common 
Language Infrastructure 
(SSCLI), there is one
simple format for the stackframe and a one calling convention.
All arguments are located
on the stack and nothing is passed in registers.&nbsp; In addition, the <b>this</b>
pointer and the  return buffer pointer, if present, are always in a fixed 
spot; and the prolog and epilog are identical from method to method.  
Finally, only the ESI register is saved.  Other details to take into account  are described below.
</p>
<p>Note: In non-JIT-compiled code, such as helper stubs, other calling 
conventions are at work, so do not expect to see a completely homogenous stack. 
All calls to or from JIT-compiled code  follow the calling convention, but 
calls between non-JIT-compiled components can follow other conventions.
</p>

<h3>Parameter Reordering</h3>
<p>Create a stack frame  as follows:
In the caller's code, up to and including the call instruction,  arguments
to the method are pushed into the pushed argument area.  After this,
the return address is pushed automatically as part of the call instruction.
Arguments are pushed onto the stack in right-to-left order (using the "CIL
calling convention").
For a function <code>void MyFunc( <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i> )</code>, parameter 
<i>a</i> is
pushed first, then <i>b</i>, and then <i>c</i>.  By the time the call instruction is encountered
in the CIL stream, the arguments have been pushed onto the stack; now the JIT
compiler will look for the first two arguments whose size
is 4 bytes or smaller, first considering <i>a</i>, then <i>b</i>, and so on.  Once two arguments 
matching the 4-byte size criterion are found, they are extended to 4 bytes (if
necessary), and then hoisted into registers ECX and EDX.  After this, the 
rest of the arguments on
the stack are moved to take up the freed space, and finally, EDX is pushed back
onto the stack, followed by ECX.
</p>
The following is an example of this sequence, for the function:<blockquote>
<code>
void MyFunc(int32 a, int64 b, int64 c, int32 d, int32 e)</code><br>
</blockquote>
<table width="50%">
<tr><td width="50%">Before IL Call instruction</td><td>Before X86 call</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top"><pre> 
Top of Stack

e - int32
d - int32 
c - int64
b - int64
a - int32

<i>(The two 4 byte arguments found are 'a' and 'd'.)</i>
</pre></td>
<td valign="top"><pre>Top of stack

a - int32
d - int32
e - int32
c - int64
b - int64
</pre></td>
</tr>
</table>

<h3>Implied Parameters</h3>
<p>The <b>this</b> pointer is a special argument which is not listed as an 
argument of the function in CIL, but is always present in method calls on 
objects. If the <b>this</b> pointer is present, it will always be the first __cdecl argument. The
"return buffer pointer" is also a special argument that does not appear in the 
CIL function signature. The  return buffer pointer will be the second __cdecl
argument if the "this pointer" is present; otherwise, it is the first argument.
</p>

<p>The following examples show these implied parameters.</p>

<table width="50%">
<tr><td valign="top"><pre> 
<b>ValueClass MyFunc(int32 a, int32 b)</b>

Top of stack

ret. buffer  - int32
a            - int32
b            - int32


<b>ValueClass MyFunc(int64 a, int32 b)</b>

Top of stack

ret. buffer  - int32
b            - int32
a            - int64


<b>ValueClass MyFunc(int64 a, int64 b)</b>

Top of stack

ret. buffer  - int32
b            - int64
a            - int64


<b>ValueClass MyFunc(int32 this_pointer, int64 b, int64 c)</b>

Top of stack

this pointer - int32
ret. buffer  - int32
c            - int64
b            - int64
</pre></td>
</tr>
</table>

<h3>FCALL Matching</h3>
<p>The order of parameters to an FCALL (see fcall.h) has to match the JIT 
calling convention described above, instead of matching the
function signature as it appears in the framework classes. In fcall.h there are a number of macros to help in converting an 
CIL-style signature to the JIT calling convention.
</p>

<h3>Variable-length Parameter Lists</h3>
For functions with a variable number of parameters, a VarArg token is passed along with arguments. The signature
of each call to a vararg function is described in the metadata, and the 
VarArg token can be used to 
look at the signature. The function signature does not describe the this 
pointer and the return buffer pointer, but the garbage collector expects 
to find them at a fixed offset, so they are pushed onto the stack after the VarArg token.
All other arguments are pushed onto the stack before the VarArg token 
from left to right, and there is no reordering to pull out 4-byte arguments.
<p>The following two examples show variable length parameter lists.
</p>

<table width="50%"> 
<tr><td valign="top"><pre> 
<b>instance vararg void MyFunc(int64 a, int32 b, ValueClass c)</b>

Top of stack

this pointer - int32
vararg token - int32
c            - sizeof( c )
b            - int32
a            - int64


<b>instance vararg ValueClass MyFunc(int64 a, int32 b, ValueClass c)</b>

Top of stack

this pointer - int32
ret. buffer  - int32
vararg token - int32
c            - sizeof( c )
b            - int32
a            - int64
</pre></td>
