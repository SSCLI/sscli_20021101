<h2><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>


<p>The debugging tool you should use with the Shared Source CLI (SSCLI) depends 
on your debugging scenario and the platform on which you are debugging. 
Debugging scenarios can be placed into three main categories: </p>


<ul>
  <li>Debugging unmanaged code.</li>
  <li>Debugging managed code running under the SSCLI.</li>
  <li>Debugging managed code from unmanaged SSCLI code.</li>
</ul>


<p>Debugging platform options have two major categories:</p>


<ul>
  <li>Debugging on Microsoft&reg; Windows&reg;.</li>
  <li>Debugging on UNIX system-based platforms.</li>
</ul>


<p>The following table shows the debugging combinations and options.</p>

    versions might be to do so.&nbsp; Check the documentation 
    for future versions of the Visual Studio development environment. </td>

<p>Debugging managed code in the .NET Framework and the SSCLI is supported by 
the debugging services APIs.&nbsp; These interfaces and functions are described 
in two documents included with the .NET Framework SDK: </p>


<ul>
  <li>...\FrameworkSDK\Tool Developers Guide\docs\Debug.doc</li>
  <li>...\FrameworkSDK\Tool Developers Guide\docs\DebugRef.doc</li>
</ul>


<h2><a name="SymbolicInformationFiles"></a>Symbolic Information Files</h2>


<p>When the SSCLI is built on Windows two 
kinds of symbolic debugging information files are generated. Unmanaged code that 
is built will generate .pdb files and managed code that is built will generate 
.ildb files. The Windows debugger tools utilize the .pdb file format. The 
Runtime Debugger (cordbg.exe on Windows) utilizes the SSCLI .ildb symbolic 
file format.&nbsp; The SOS debugger extension does not use either format of debug 
information.</p>


<p>You can convert between the .ildb format and .pdb format using the
<a href="../tools/ildbconv.html">ildbconv</a> conversion tool.&nbsp; You can 
take an assembly built using the SSCLI tools, convert the corresponding .ildb 
file to .pdb format, and then debug that assembly running under the .NET 
Framework using Visual Studio .NET.</p>
<p>When the SSCLI is built on UNIX system-based platforms, the gcc compiler 
generates the symbolic 
information for unmanaged code using the -g 
option. On most systems this  results in the stabs debugging 
information format which will be stored directly in the binary files and not as 
separate debugging information files.</p>


<h2><a name="DebuggingandtheCLILoggingInfrastructure"></a>Debugging and the CLI Logging Infrastructure</h2>


<p>Several environment variables are used by the CLI logging 
infrastructure which can be very useful when debugging the SSCLI or managed code 
running in the SSCLI.</p>


<p>The following table describes some of the most useful environment variables 
for use with debugging.</p>

<table  border="1" WIDTH="1003" >
  <tr>
    <th valign="top" width="261">Configuration setting</th>
    <th valign="top" width="216">Values</th>
    <th valign="top" width="486">Comment</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top" width="261">COMPlus_BreakOnEELoad</td>
    <td valign="top" width="216">0 or 1 </td>
    <td valign="top" width="486">Breaks into the debugger on CLI startup if 
    value is 1.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top" width="261">COMPlus_BreakOnEEShutdown</td>
    <td valign="top" width="216">0 or 1 </td>
    <td valign="top" width="486">Breaks into the debugger on CLI shutdown if 
    value is 1.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top" width="261">COMPlus_BreakOnClassBuild</td>
    <td valign="top" width="216"><i>ClassName</i></td>
    <td valign="top" width="486">Breaks into the debugger when loading <i>ClassName</i>.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top" width="261">COMPlus_JitBreak</td>
    <td valign="top" width="216"><i>ClassName.MethodName</i></td>
    <td valign="top" width="486">Breaks into the debugger before JIT-compiling method</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top" width="261">COMPlus_JitHalt</td>
    <td valign="top" width="216"><i>ClassName.MethodName</i></td>
    <td valign="top" width="486">Breaks into the debugger just after 
    JIT-compiling method but before executing it.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


<p>All the options above result in assert dialogs from the SSCLI on Windows except 
COMPlusJitHalt.&nbsp; The assert dialog will have content such as the following 
when <code>set COMPlus_BreakOnEELoad=1</code> is set:</p>


<blockquote>


<pre>---------------------------
Assert Failure (PID 6016, Thread 4284/10bc)        
---------------------------
!"Loading EE!"

d:\sscli\clr\src\vm\wks\..\ceemain.cpp, Line: 296

Abort - Kill program
Retry - Debug
Ignore - Keep running


Image:
D:\sscli\build\v1.x86chk.rotor\clix.exe

---------------------------
Abort   Retry   Ignore   
---------------------------
</pre>


</blockquote>


<p>Select the &quot;Retry&quot; button to return back into the debugger at the point where 
the assert was thrown.&nbsp; The Retry button will cause a rethrow of the 
assertion and debuggers will normally catch the second assert and halt.</p>


<p>The COMPlus_JitHalt setting will not cause an assert dialog and will simply 
halt the debugger immediately after JIT-compiling code for the specified method 
and just before running that code.</p>


<p>See <a href="../techinfo/logging.html">logging.html</a> for more details on 
the CLI logging infrastructure.</p>


<h2><a name="JIT-attachDebugging"></a>JIT-Attach Debugging</h2>


<p>Just-in-time (JIT)-attach debugging is the term used to describe attaching a debugger to an 
executable image that has thrown an unhandled exception. JIT-attach debugging of 
unmanaged code is 
occurring on Windows when you see a message box that invites you to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Click OK to terminate the program.</li>
  <li>Click Cancel to debug the program. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you click Cancel, a debugger starts and attaches to the process. The 
Windows setting for JIT-attach debugging of unmanaged code is set in the registry 
at: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\Current 
Version\AeDebug.</p>


<p>JIT-attach debugging has no direct relationship to JIT compilation other than 
sharing the &quot;JIT&quot; acronym.</p>


<p>In SSCLI builds, the default behavior  for JIT-attach debugging of managed code 
that throws unhandled exceptions is as follows:</p>


<ul>
  <li>On Windows,  attachment to the Runtime Debugger  is enabled by 
  default.</li>
  <li>On UNIX system-based platforms attachment is disabled by default.</li>
</ul>
<p>The settings and the name of the debugger are set in source code in
<a href="../../clr/src/debug/ee/debugger.cpp">debugger.cpp</a> as shown in the following 
code:</p>


<blockquote>


<pre>#ifdef PLATFORM_UNIX
    WCHAR *defaultDbgCmd = L"cordbg !a 0x%x";
#else
    WCHAR *defaultDbgCmd = L"cordbg.exe !a 0x%x";
#endif

</pre>


</blockquote>


<p>...</p>


<blockquote>


<pre>#ifdef PLATFORM_UNIX
    // don't launch the cordbg by default on Unix
    dwSetting = 1;
#else
    // show a dialog by default on Windows
    dwSetting = 0;
#endif
</pre>


</blockquote>


<p>To change the default settings set the COMPlus_DbgJITDebugLaunchSetting 
environment variable to:</p>


<ul>
  <li>0 to enable JIT-attach debugging.</li>
  <li>1 to disable JIT-attach debugging.</li>
</ul>


<p>The environment variable will be used it if is present; otherwise the 
defaults will remain in effect.&nbsp; </p>


<p>On Windows the JIT-attach debugging behavior when it is enabled is as follows:</p>


<ol>
  <li>An unhandled exception occurs in managed code.</li>
  <li>A message box appears.&nbsp; For example:</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>


<pre>---------------------------
clix.exe - Common Language Runtime Debugging Services
---------------------------
Application has generated an exception that could not be handled. 

Process id=0x108c (4236), Thread id=0x1100 (4352). 

Click OK to terminate the application. 
Click CANCEL to debug the application.
---------------------------
OK Cancel 
---------------------------</pre>


  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<ol start="3">
  <li>If you click Cancel, then the  Runtime Debugger is started.</li>
  <li>If you click OK,  another message box appears.&nbsp; For example:</li>

</ol>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>


<pre>---------------------------
clix.exe - Application Error
---------------------------
The exception Integer division by zero.

 (0xc0000094) occurred in the application at location 0x02ca2d94.


Click on OK to terminate the program
Click on CANCEL to debug the program
---------------------------
OK   Cancel   
---------------------------
</pre>


  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    This second message box is the unmanaged code JIT-attach debugging message.</blockquote>
<ol start="5">    
  <li>If you click Cancel, the currently registered unmanaged code debugger in 
  the registry starts.</li>
  <li>If you click OK, no debugger starts. Unhandled exception 
  output should be sent to the console.</li>
</ol>


<p>With  JIT-attach debugging disabled, the first message box does not appear and 
you  have the option of debugging using the unmanaged code debugger only.</p>


<p>On UNIX system-based platforms enable SSCLI JIT-attach debugging by setting 
the COMPlus_DbgJITDebugLaunchSetting environment variable to 0 as shown in the 
following example:</p>


<blockquote>


<pre>setenv COMPlus_DbgJITDebugLaunchSetting 0</pre>


</blockquote>


<p>Now when an unhandled exception occurs in managed code the Runtime Debugger 
starts to debug the managed application.</p>


<h2><a name="DebuggingManagedCodeRunningintheSSCLI"></a>Debugging Managed Code Running in the SSCLI</h2>


<p>The SSCLI supports a subset of the debugging functionality supported by the 
.NET Framework. In particular, the SSCLI does not have sufficient debugging support to 
use  Microsoft&reg; Visual Studio .NET development to debug managed code 
running in the SSCLI. The Microsoft CLR Debugger included with the .NET 
Framework SDK is a variant of the Visual Studio .NET debugger and cannot be used 
to debug managed code running under the SSCLI.</p>


<p>The only option available for debugging managed code running under the SSCLI 
is to use the Runtime Debugger (cordbg.exe on Windows, cordbg on UNIX 
system-based platforms).</p>


<p>For more information see the <a href="../tools/cordbg.html">Runtime Debugger</a> 
documentation.</p>


<p>On Windows you must be in an SSCLI console window in which an SSCLI 
environment has been successfully built to ensure that you have a working copy 
of the SSCLI version of cordbg.exe in your path. If you are not in a SSCLI 
console window, you might inadvertently be running the .NET Framework SDK 
implementation of cordbg.exe which will not launch the application being 
debugged under the SSCLI. You do not have to explicitly use the
<a href="../tools/clix.html">clix</a> SSCLI application launching utility when 
you debug with the Runtime Debugger because the SSCLI implementation of the 
debugger always starts all applications using the clix launcher.&nbsp; </p>


<p>If  the code that you develop under the SSCLI will also run under the .NET 
Framework, then you might choose to use the Visual Studio .NET debugger on 
Windows and debug the code running under the .NET Framework. You can then run 
the debugged application under the SSCLI by using the clix launcher.</p>


<p>On FreeBSD  a known problem with kernels compiled for multi-processor 
computers will cause the Runtime Debugger to function incorrectly. For more 
information see the
<a href="../relnotes.html#CorDBGDebuggerandMulti-processorKernelsonFreeBSD">
release notes</a>.</p>


<h2><a name="DebuggingUnmanagedSSCLICodeonWindows"></a>Debugging Unmanaged SSCLI Code on Windows</h2>


<p>On Windows the preferred debugger for debugging unmanaged code is the Visual 
Studio .NET debugger. To debug the SSCLI execution environment use the 
following steps:</p>


<ol>
  <li>Set up an SSCLI console window using the <a href="../buildtools/env.html">
  env.bat</a> batch file with either the checked or the fastchecked option. Because the fastchecked build option will introduce optimizations into the 
  built code that might cause binary code to be moved relative to its source 
  position in the source file, it is preferable to use the checked option.</li>
  <li>Build the SSCLI.</li>
  <li>From the SSCLI console window, execute the following command:
</ol>
  <blockquote>


  <pre>devenv /debugexe %TARGETCOMPLUS%\clix.exe &lt;path_to_managed_application&gt;</pre>


  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    The debugger will start up and create a default project for the clix 
  launcher which is the application being debugged.&nbsp;
  </blockquote>
  <ol start="4">
  <li>To start the debugger, choose <b>Step Into</b> from the <b>Debug</b> menu, (usually mapped to the F11 key). This will start debugging the clix application launcher.</li>
  <li>After the debugger starts, you might be asked to save the solution file. Save the file in the default location.<p>You should now see the breakpoint waiting on the second line below (the 
  opening brace) in 
  clix.cpp:
  </li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>


<pre>int __cdecl main(int argc, char ** argv, char ** envp)
{
    DWORD nExitCode = 1; // error
    WCHAR* pwzCmdLine;

    PAL_RegisterLibrary(L"rotor_palrt");
</pre>


  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<ol start="6">
  
  <li>You can now open other source files and set breakpoints or simply step 
  through the SSCLI initialization process using the <b>Step Into</b> and <b>Step Over</b> 
  commands.</li>
</ol>


<h3><a name="OtherDebuggersOnWindows"></a>Other Debuggers On Windows</h3>


<p>There are times when Windows platform debuggers can be a useful substitute for 
the Visual Studio .NET debugger. You should install the latest debugging tools 
for Windows from the
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/ddk/debugging/">Microsoft Debugging Tools</a> 
Web page to make sure that you have the most up-to-date version of the debuggers 
on your computer.&nbsp;You can then use the NTSD, CDB, or WinDbg Windows 
debuggers to debug the unmanaged code portions of the SSCLI.&nbsp;The process 
of debugging is very similar to using the Visual Studio .NET debugger.</p>


<ol>
  <li>Set up an SSCLI console window using the <a href="../buildtools/env.html">
  env.bat</a> batch file with either the checked or the fastchecked option. Because the fastchecked build option will introduce optimizations into the 
  built code that might cause binary code to be moved relative to its source 
  position in the source file, it is preferable to use the checked option.</li>
  <li>Build the SSCLI.</li>
  <li>From the SSCLI console window, execute the following command:<blockquote>


<pre>ntsd clix.exe &lt;path_to_managed_application&gt;</pre>


  </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>You will initially stop at a breakpoint in the ntdll.dll module.&nbsp; At 
  this point you can bring in source-level debugging information by using the 
  .lines command.&nbsp; You should then set a breakpoint.&nbsp; For example, to 
  get the  same location as you would by default with the Visual Studio .NET 
  debugger and to step at the source level, use the  commands shown in boldin the 
  following example. Some intermediate output has been removed for clarity.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>

For more information on these debugging tools, see the documentation included with the Microsoft Platform debuggers. Also see the section below on 
debugging unmanaged code with the SOS debugging extension.<p>You can also use 
any other debugger that can debug Windows to debug the unmanaged code in the SSCLI. You will need to ensure that these alternate debuggers can utilize the .PDB 
symbolic information format if you want to debug at the source line level.</p>
<h3><a name="AttachingtoaRunningProcessonWindows"></a>Attaching to a Running Process on Windows</h3>
<p>In some cases an error will cause an assertion in the SSCLI or the SSCLI to 
stop responding. It is useful to be able to attach to the running process to diagnose 
the source of the problem. </p>
<p>To attach to a running process using Visual Studio .NET, start the 
development environment and select the <b>Debug Processes</b> from the <b>Tools</b> 
menu to 
display a list of running processes and attach to clix.exe. In this mode 
of using the development environment it is useful to be able to view the list of 
Miscellaneous files that are source files opened in the course of 
debugging.&nbsp; To view these files, on the <b>Tools</b> menu choose <b>Options</b> 
and select 
the <b>Documents</b> node under <b>Environments</b>.&nbsp; Select the item named 
<b>Show Miscellaneous files in Solution Explorer</b>.</p>
<p>To attach to a running process using the Windows debugging tools, start NTSD 
or CDB with the <b>-pn</b> option and specify clix.exe as the process name. </p>
<h2><a name="DebuggingUnmanagedSSCLICodeonUNIXSystem-basedPlatforms"></a>Debugging Unmanaged SSCLI Code on UNIX System-based Platforms</h2>


<p>The  GDB debugger is usually used to debug SSCLI unmanaged code on UNIX 
system-based platforms. The following example shows a typical session using the GDB 
debugger on Mac&reg; OS X.&nbsp; Some console output has been removed for clarity.</p>


<blockquote>

<p>You can also attach to an already-running process that has thrown an assert 
or otherwise needs to be debugged by using the attach command from within GDB.</p>


<p>For more information, see the GDB info or man pages. There are also many 
Web sites that provide helpful details on using the GDB debugger.</p>


<h2><a name="DebuggingManagedCodeFromUnmanagedSSCLICode"></a>Debugging Managed Code From Unmanaged SSCLI Code</h2>


<p>Although you cannot use the Visual Studio .NET debugger to debug both the 
unmanaged SSCLI implementation code and managed code running under the SSCLI, 
you can use the SOS debugger extension to obtain additional functionality to 
support navigating through the managed code that is currently being executed.</p>


<p>For more information on the SOS debugging extension usage under Windows and 
UNIX system-based platforms see the <a href="sos.html">sos.html</a> document .</p>
